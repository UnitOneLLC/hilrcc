Our first session will focus on the revolutionary shifts in image-making prior to invention and examine the processes of the primary inventors: Wedgwood, Talbot, Daguerre and Bayard. Topics will include aesthetic developments with the “art” of the calotype; documentary efforts of the early daguerreotypists; expeditionary photography in the Middle East and Asia; colonial conflicts and the American Civil War; major art movements of Pictorialism and Naturalism; and the evolution of landscape photography as a genre unto itself by the century’s end.

Very enticing subject for a study group.  The CD needs to be a single paragraph.  The 1982 version of the Newhall book is pricey at $49.  There is a 1978 version for under $5.  Would the older version be acceptable?  (The original version was written in 1939)13 Oct 2018 6:56 pm: Ron Ebert

A wonderful topic, but could be rewritten to be a bit more clear and leave out certain details which will not be familiar to most people (?calotype).  Suffice it to say that the history of the photographic process will be discussed, including the limitations of the each process, the types of cameras used etc...Also, I think the number of ""topics"" feels too overwhelming for 6wks.  (Could spend 6 wks on ""Pictorialism and Naturalism""  alone.) Easily a 10 or 12 wk class especially if you throw in a visit or two to the Harvard Art Museum.14 Oct 2018 10:03 am: Addison Stone
Agree that this is a good topic, presented by a knowledgeable SGL. The last sentence of the CD should be integrated with the paragraph, with parens removed. I'm okay with the content of the CD otherwise but agree with Ron that the details re first session are not necessary. Two minor edits: in first sentence, need comma after ""century""; in second sentence, ""but applications..."" should be ""but also for applications....""

Is there really a ""Southern frame of mind"" or is this a myth that Southerners harbor about their own uniqueness? If “the South” does exist, how is this reflected in its literature, history and culture? How do Southern writers provide us with complex portrayals of the American South? Although Southern literature has been characterized by a love of storytelling, family, community and place, it is also discussed in terms of military defeat and an obsession with race and class. In this study group, we will read and discuss Southern literature, from the earliest Native American creation stories through  colonial and Civil War short stories, essays and poems to contemporary narratives of the multicultural “new” South. All HILR members interested in culture, history and literature are welcome to a “downhome” discussion of the literature (short stories, documentaries, poetry and essays) of the American South.

She could leave out "" (short stories, documentaries, poetry and essays) "" in last sentence as she has mentioned various genres previously and could leave out the 2nd sentence.  That would free up some space to mention some of the authors.  But I would understand if she prefers not to.

Since I more or less helped Stephen come up with this course, I think it has merit.  Stephen is a terrific travel blogger and his own writing in this genre has a lot to offer. The CD should be more formally written, which could easily be done by including the bullets into a coherent paragraph. I suggest he include a number of well known travel writers whose work they could examine as examples at the beginning of the course. Otherwise, course follows format of previous writing course I took with Bob Kinerk, which was highly successful.13 Oct 2018 3:07 pm: Sara Freedman
I would also make his bio less self-deprecating and include the fact that he writes a travel blog.13 Oct 2018 3:16 pm: Mickey Zemon
The CD is too short.  And he needs to combine what he has above into one paragraph.  He mentions Reading and discussing excerpts from the works of travel writers.  Suggest he mention a few of these writers and what distinguishes them from others who write in this genre.
There are many good books about travel writing, and he should assign one of them and not just rely on handouts.
A little more information about how many guest speakers and how much class time they will take up would be good -- and who might these guest speakers be?
A very appealing proposal -- all of us like to travel and share the interesting things that happen along the way.
13 Oct 2018 6:42 pm: Ron Ebert
Seems like a travel memoir class. In addition to rewriting cd by making sentences out of the bullets, and putting into one paragraph, he definitely should add his blog in bio and add “of” before books. T and l should assist him to think through how to structure his course. 13 Oct 2018 9:25 pm: Linda Neumann
Agree with Mickey that he should mention some of the travel writers, if he would not use a book.  Also would be interesting to hear what are the challenges or what characterizes writing travel memoirs.  Obviously he needs to get rid of the bullets.  Bio could be more enticing.14 Oct 2018 9:18 am: Barbara Burr

Many of his most famous pieces, such as the Third and Fifth Symphonies and the Appassionata Sonata, validate that image.

Our aims in this course are to focus on these several personae, as revealed in the music; to analyze what features of a particular piece make it humorous, tragic, etc.; to expose the SGMs to many of the composer’s less often heard compositions; and to address the difficult question of whether the music’s emotional content can or cannot be directly related to events in Beethoven’s life. The format will involve some lecturing on the part of the SGLs, followed by listening and discussion. SGMs will be expected to listen to the compositions under discussion several times before coming to class, aided by listening guides.

The Weininger courses have also been well received and clearly are music appreciation with lots of music history of the composers and the times. I suspect that most of us have been in at least one of their courses.  My only suggestion is CD needs to be shortened by taking out second and last sentence. Both their bios need shortening.  Note as indicated this course given last spring.  Suggest it be repeated on different day to open options for those with restricted days at HILR.  ACCEPT  12 Oct 2018 7:12 pm: Mickey Zemon
I agree with Frank about deleting second and last sentence and trimming the bios.  Also agree about the great value of this course.
Fourth sentence:  change ''Our aims in this course'' to ''Our objectives are to'' -- also delete the etc in this sentence and ''or cannot'' after can
Other required materials:  SGMs will be provided with background material and listening guides for each of the six sessions - how will these be provided?  on course website? a course pack? are these materials accessible through Google? if not, are they going to be scanned?  are they under copyright?  How are they going to distribute ""CDs containing recordings of the compositions'' to all class members?12 Oct 2018 7:40 pm: Penny Revelle
Rather than deleting the second sentence I think I would combine the 1st and 2nd: ""The common image of Beethoven is that of a heroic figure and his most famous pieces, ie the third and fifth symphonies, validate that image.""
Take out the words ""on the part of the SGLs"" in the 5th sentence and delete the last sentence.  That would bring the CD down to 150 words.
Otherwise looks good.12 Oct 2018 8:34 pm: Barbara Burr
Excellent topic for a course, sand should be of wide interest.  I agree with above suggestions and would only add that I found the 3rd sentence a bit odd (""wider variety...of multiple personae""), though I think I know what they mean (that his music has much more depth and nuance than just ""heroic"").  Just needs a little little editing as others suggest.13 Oct 2018 8:26 am: Addison Stone
Agree this would be a good offering. Penny's suggested edits all seem good. Bio's should be shortened (remove Jennifer's UG degree and either eliminate or shorten Stephen's first sentence).13 Oct 2018 9:14 am: Helen Bakeman

I like Penny's combining of the first and second sentences.  I agree with Barbara that the third sentence is a odd.

Wonderful idea for a HILR course. Two SGLs are highly qualified to teach it. CD well organized, clear and informative. Eliminate period after ""critical matter.""12 Oct 2018 6:07 pm: Frank Speizer
Last sentence is confusing.  Is the plan for the SGMs to take the 140 item food frequency questionnaire and actually try to analysis it?  I assume the second half of the sentence should be the SGLs rather than the SGM.  There is room in CD to be more descriptive of the various popular diets that will be considered.  The second sentence really presents two different thoughts that should be separated.  The first half is about diet, the second is about the science and biology of how food changes the gut.  The later should probably come after the next sentence.  I think the SGLs need to rethink whether they want to talk about science of diet, food choice and health.  Trying to bring the two together may be too much as this is really a complex subject for 6 weeks. 12 Oct 2018 6:19 pm: Mickey Zemon
I agree -- great idea for an HILR course, well organized CD, well qualified leaders.
Second sentence:  in the diet -- needs a qualifier -- e.g., the normal diet, the healthy diet, your diet, our diet???

Suggest changing this to online dietary analysis for each SGM  as well as through reading and discussion of a selection of relevant articles.  She mentions in this sentence ""selection of a topic"" -- does this mean each member is going to report on a topic?  What it means should be clearly stated in the CD.
Bio: no need to mention that this is first time Brodsky has been an SGL.12 Oct 2018 7:49 pm: Penny Revelle
Well, any course that offers food samples sounds good to me.  But do we have to be careful here not to stray into self-help territory?  I would leave out ""so that more informed decisions can be made about diet."" and put in something more about how the SGM's are going to be involved in the section of topics and articles.
12 Oct 2018 8:22 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree it is a worthwhile and complex topic - it will be important to emphasize this SG is not meant as a nutrition consultation but really to consider the big questions about the science of nutrition as it pertains to aging and the controversies, of which there are many!  12 Oct 2018 11:36 pm: Linda Neumann
This may be a case of trying to encourage too much member participation.  Given that this is a 6 week course and given the experience and expertise of the leaders, it seems that the time would be better spent learning from their scientific and nutritional background.  The online dietary analysis sounds great, but what of members selecting topics and articles?  Are they expected to choose subjects and material for presentations?  Perhaps change ""so that more informed decisions can be made about diet"" to something like ""to better understand the issues and options for healthy nutrition""
Definitely a good topic and could be very good.13 Oct 2018 8:17 am: Addison Stone
Yes, a good topic and well-qualified SGLs, but agree that the emphasis should be a bit more on the science and a bit weaker on the self-help/participation theme. In that spirit, I'd like to see something about the additional readings moved from Other Preparation  to Additional Required Materials, which is actually missing. Need to clarify what role SGMs would play in choosing topics/articles (final sentence). How practical is that in a 6-week SG? Might be better if the SGL's picked a couple more topics to include and mention them in the CD.13 Oct 2018 10:41 am: David Bliss
I found the 2001 version of the book (used) for under $5. But the newer version seems to be much more expensive (over $100).  Is there a reason why they require the 2017 version?  Or do they mean the 2009 version? There is room in the CD to mention some of the new fad diets like the paleo diet.  Will they be analysing some of these diets?13 Oct 2018 12:34 pm: Susan Harris
David, I don't know where you were looking, but the 2017 edition of the book is $13.59 at Amazon today (paperback).13 Oct 2018 5:52 pm: Ron Ebert
Cd is a bit short. Might give an example of “flip flp” advice.

Appealing CD, but would like an idea of the kinds of questions (other than examining the character of Atticus Finch) that the SG will pursue since the two books together and separately raise a myriad of question, trivial and profound. Need more information on focus, substance. It looks like two class periods will be used almost entirely to show two movies. Are the books that light that they only merit four weeks of discussion, together? 12 Oct 2018 6:18 pm: Frank Speizer
Sara suggests the movies will be shown in class.  I don't quite get that from reading the CD.  Since they are listed in the other required materials I assume they are to be seen at home and excerpts seen in class to make points.  Needs clarification.  Agree some questions, particularly directed in area of racial discrimination should be mentioned (to further justify the additional, and otherwise unrelated excerpts from additional films),  The later could be described in lesser detail or even left out and simply brought into class as additional material.  I have not read the second book, mainly because of the controversy raised by its posthumous publication, but more might be said as to why he want to use it.  With revision I think this course will work. 12 Oct 2018 6:30 pm: Mickey Zemon
Jon led this study group a year or so ago, and I heard good things about it.  My only suggestions are to delete the last sentence in the CD and remove the comma between group and on Baseball in his bio.12 Oct 2018 6:33 pm: Mickey Zemon
It must have been someone else who taught a course on To Kill a Mockingbird since he does not mention it in his bio.12 Oct 2018 7:37 pm: David Bliss
The CD speaks of excerpts from one movie: In the Heat of the Night,  and analyzing the movie To Kill a Mockingbird.  It doesn't seem like too much movie watching in a 6-week course. The titles of the movie and the books should be in italics.  12 Oct 2018 7:58 pm: Penny Revelle
Two books and a movie sound like enough material for a 6 week course to me.  Maybe the excerpts from in the Heat of the Night don't need to be in the CD, but could be noted  on the class website.  This would keep the CD more focused and help potential SGMs decide about the SG.12 Oct 2018 8:14 pm: Barbara Burr
(I think To Kill a Mockingbird was a movie in the courtroom cinema SG). If two book are being used, I would imagine the movie could be watched at home.  I would be interested to know why bring in In the Heat of the Night...or how it illuminates our understanding of Mockingbird.  No need to go into so much Oscar stuff.  Better to focus on issues raised etc.  12 Oct 2018 11:18 pm: Linda Neumann
Needs to clarify how the movies will be acquired to be seen at home.  Agree that the Heat of the Night is better left out of the CD as it doesn't seem crucial in a study of Mockingbird.  Mockingbird raises many non trivial issues which should be mentioned, other than the final words on the ""issue of racial discrimination.""    No need to give details of the Oscars.  13 Oct 2018 8:03 am: Addison Stone
I agree re the need to provide greater clarity re central questions to be addressed.  Also agree with deleting mention of Heat of the Night, unless its relevance becomes stronger with modifications re central questions. Also agree that we don't need to hear about all of the Oscars. This isn't really, or primarily, a film course. At least, I don't think it is. Jon's response to requests for revision will hopefully serve to clarify purpose.13 Oct 2018 8:44 am: Susan Harris
I agree with comments above that the CD should say less about the Oscars, leave out Heat of the Night, indicate more clearly what at-home watching will include, and (somewhere, maybe not in CD) say how SGMs may obtain the movies if they need to.  With space saved from reducing Oscar verbiage, the CD could also say a bit more about specific questions to be addressed in the course.  Should be a good course and the addition of Go Set A Watchman is a plus because of its fairly recent release.13 Oct 2018 5:58 pm: Ron Ebert

These two operas have a lot in common. They are both based on plays written by the French dramatist, Beaumarchais (1732-1799). They even share a number of characters, most notably Figaro, Count Almaviva, Rosina, Bartolo and Basilio. Both are Italian social comedies. Musically they have a similar structure. Yet, because Rossini is no Mozart and because the world had changed dramatically in the 30 years between the two compositions, they make a very different impression. Many would say that ""Barber"" is purely comedic while ""The Marriage of Figaro"" adds drama and pathos. We shall explore those differences.

Could be an interesting SG, though I know nothing about Valerie. Does she have relevant expertise in music and/or teaching beyond what she says in the Bio? I like the description of the book on Amazon ("" shows how operas give musical and dramatic expression to ideas about the self, society, and history""). Will this be part of the course? If so, it would be good to say something about that.
In sentence 1, should ""opera buffa"" be changed to ""comic operas,"" given that the final sentence suggests an interest in attracting those without opera experience? In any case, that sentence makes for a rather dull lead-in. Could add a touch of intrigue by saying something like,""Why did two of our most renowned opera composers base works on the same play? How do they differ, and how do those differences affect us?"" I don't the list of shared characters adds much.
Under Other Required Materials, it might be better to say simply ""Listening to selected recordings of the operas in the Loeb Music Library collection.""
 Is it realistic to plan for ""occasional visitors, a performing musician, and a real live conductor"" in a 6-week SG? Has Valerie led previous SGs? Bio needs condensing.11 Oct 2018 5:46 pm: David Bliss
Valerie is a new SGL, and she does not have the musicology expertise that Ron Goodman has, but she was enthusiastic at the brown bag meeting. Since this will be given in the second half and Ron's will be the first half, the two SGs will not be competing.  If the SGMs are to listen to both entire operas in class, there will not be a lot of time left for the discussions.  She is quite certain that her friend and conductor will visit one class session.  I am uncertain as to how she will lead the discussions.  Does she have a list of questions for the class? 11 Oct 2018 6:23 pm: Mickey Zemon
Valerie has been at HILR for five years and has been thinking about giving a course on opera over the past year or so.
She has great enthusiasm for opera and knows a great deal about it.
I am wondering if the title should be changed to Figaro, Figaro: Mozart vs Rossini (: rather than ;)
Sentence that starts with Yet, because Rossini is no Mozart needs to be improved - perhaps dashes after Mozart and after compositions.
In the next to the last sentence ""We shall explore those differences"" she should say how --e.g., through reading, viewing  and listening to portions of the operas, and class discussion.  We should find out  just how much class time will be used viewing the operas.  Will some operas be viewed or listed to at home as part of class preparation?

; followed by ) was ;)12 Oct 2018 9:47 am: Barbara Burr
I think this sounds like a wonderful introduction to learning about at least some aspects of opera.  It is not a music theory course obviously, but for anyone wanting to gain new perspectives on understanding opera, it seems worthwhile.  (And people who teach art courses or literature courses at HILR are often not artists or English professors, so I think this is in the same vein.)  Agree with Mickey's edits.12 Oct 2018 10:07 am: Linda Neumann
Agree with Mickey.  It should be clear that members are listening to the operas at home - at least I assume so-  and listening to selected portions during class.   She can put the music directly onto the course website, using whatever performances she chooses.  Probably better to have everyone listen to the same version.   Perhaps change "" Rossini is no Mozart"" to ""Rossini is not Mozart"" - seems dismissive of Rossini.  She can take out the cast of characters and add something about discussing the book.  Should appeal to opera buffs.12 Oct 2018 3:43 pm: Susan Harris
I think the CD is pretty good the way it is, but agree that it should be clearer about what is expected for homework (agreeing with Mickey's last comment).  12 Oct 2018 3:51 pm: Helen Bakeman
With the edits suggested, this looks  good to go. The bio could use some trimming, something like....”While in college, VA spent many Saturday’s taking the “opera bus” to the Met”, delete second sentence, delete “then” from 3rd sentence.12 Oct 2018 4:01 pm: Katherine O'Connor
I think it's great that Valerie is finally offering a study group.  She is an excellent class contributor and will not, I am confident, be a boring SGL.  I agree with Addison that opera buffa is best rendered as comic operas and that the shared characters don't need to be named. The CD could be more specific about the most striking differences between the two operas.   12 Oct 2018 5:51 pm: Frank Speizer
The book sounds good but I am concerned with how the librettos will be used.  If these are just to follow the text in a class listening session it seems like as others have indicated that too much class time will be simply listening.  Given the 10 years of HD Opera from the Met both these operas have probably been done and are probably available for home viewing.(need to check public as well as Loeb Library).  Like suggestion above for putting some contrasting questions in CD.  With modest revision, think this is an ACCEPT12 Oct 2018 8:11 pm: Penny Revelle
I actually like the CD the way it is, except for some clarification about where and when the operas will be watched.  She could also say in the 9th sentence ""We shall explore those differences and discuss the ideas in Robinson's book.""  to give some idea about how the course will be conducted.
If she is not showing both whole operas in class then I think she has room for performing musicians and a conductor.  13 Oct 2018 3:39 pm: Sara Freedman
Intriguing course. Needs a jazzier opening. One suggestion: ""Two of our most famous and beloved Italian comic operas, Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro (1786) and Rossini's Barber of Seville (1816) share many of the same elements but present the listener/viewer with very different experiences"" which would get more quickly to the heart of the course. CD also needs more information on the structure of the course and what participants are supposed to do for homework other than read the book (which is very interesting and provides a sound intellectual and musical background for the course.) One other item about the book: the chapter on the two operas is the first chapter and nothing else in the book is pertinent. Would it be cheaper to use Gnomon to copy that chapter, get copyright, etc so that people don't have to buy the entire book?
Not sure about Valerie's expertise in subject matter, particularily her ability to lead discussions on the musical aspects important to the course. Suggest a discussion with her about that.","false","","120","2018-10-11 10:18:55","https://ccsubmit.com/","","","","","","Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/69.0.3497.100 Safari/537.36","71.233.94.234","","complete","complete","","complete","pending","complete","","","","","","pending","13","1539288174"

A good, solid topic for anyone wanting an introduction to cell biology.  2nd sentence should be ""progress...that reveals...and demonstrates...""

I had to drop out of a similar course because it was much too difficult for someone without a solid science/biology background. Could be a great course for those who do have such a background.10 Oct 2018 9:48 pm: Mickey Zemon
I think this will be a terrific class, and know people who are still raving about the last class on cells that Herb led a few years ago.  It will be tough for people who do not have a background in biology and/or chemistry but there are many people at HILR who do have this background.
Regarding the book: a used copy of the 6th edition is available from Barnes &amp; Nobles for $4.42. 
The title of the book is not The Cell. A Molecular Approach but The Cell: A Molecular Approach
4th line up from bottom of CD:  it says assigned cell biology textbook sources -- are these in addition to the text for the course?  Also mentions a topic review --perhaps need to explain what that is exactly.

Sounds as if prior background is necessary based on sara’s experience. Mickey- what is the title? Issue of book and edition has to be simplified and clarified.11 Oct 2018 2:44 pm: Addison Stone
Should be of great appeal to those with science backgrounds. Agree that he should use either the 6th or 7th edition. Knowledge in this area is moving fast! Judy may be right that used copies of the 6th edition is a reasonable compromise, though I did find paperback copies of the 7th ed at Amazon for $68, which I think is not unreasonable for a science text. Agree about deleting the last sentence from Other Required. Note that he says only that SGM presentations will be ""considered."" I see no reason to put this sentence anywhere. 
In sentence 2, the subject is ""progress,"" so both ""reveal"" and ""demonstrate"" need a final -s. Need a comma after ""environment"" in third sentence, and after ""functions"" in fourth sentence. Suggest breading sentence 4 into two sentences.
Given what folks say about the difficulty level of the previous offering, does the statement that past courses are ""helpful but not essential"" present a problem re truth in advertising?

I took this course from Herb last year.  His lectures were accessible to non-scientists, but demanding for those who want to go deeper.  It is a fascinating story. The book was very helpful for anyone who wants to go deeper than the class lectures. The book I used was a used 5th or 6th edition that was about $15.  The precise edition is not important, because they all have similar illustrations and diagrams. Just the chapter numbers may be different.11 Oct 2018 10:52 pm: Helen Bakeman
I think that Herb’s caveat about “helpful but not essential” clearly conveys that this will be a stretch but possible for non scientists (I am taking such a science course now and I learn what I can and am very pleased when I understand things).

Agree with much of the above.  I talked with Herb at the Brown Bag, and he indicated he is offering this course again, as he was told there was a waiting list last time.  (Can we check on how the evaluations went?)  Should the CD specify this is a lecture course (if that is what it is)?  In bio, take out his funding by NIH.  13 Oct 2018 11:57 am: Susan Harris

This course will trace the circuitous path which led Olmsted to his true calling, a path which intersected the major historical events of 19<sup>th</sup> century America. It will cover a range of selected landscape projects and will explore the esthetic and philosophical principles which guided his work. The course will employ a PowerPoint presentation format, but will also include weekly discussion questions and an optional field trip to the Olmsted National Historic Site in Brookline.

I took this course last time and it was great.  The book is very good and essential to the course for providing the story of Olmstead's very interesting life.  Al's slides show various Olmstead projects in beautiful photography and his commentary brought the history and the artistry of Olmstead's work to life.  He lectures a bit but members were always welcomed to break in and plenty of discussion took place.  The field trip was fun and informative.

Would like more information about the structure of the course - lecture, discussion, etc? Curious why he is submitting it so early, perhaps because he is new to the process and doesn't quite understand it. Sounds like it could be a terrific course if he finally gives it.09 Oct 2018 9:39 pm: Jim Whitters
I concur with both Mickey and Sara----we should cut to the chase and find out whether he wants to lead the course in the Spring or really wants to lead it next Fall or later.

Sounds quite intriguing, but he himself says that there's too much prep work involved to be ready for the spring semester.

Agree with Penny and David in particular and with others.  He does not really appear to be thinking of the Spring and could use some consultation with TLC.  He probably could find all he needs at Harvard Museum without including the MFA.  I think he also will put off people if he want to do some sketching in class.

Good CD and interesting topic.
First sentence: Why are the F and T in Cosi fan tutte not in upper-case letters?
He needs a concluding sentence that explains how the course is going to be structured.  What percentage of class time is going to be used to view the operas?  How much time discussing the book?
The book he is using is 428 pages long, a substantial amount of reading per class for 6 weeks. 
Other required materials: What and how much online materials in ""links to articles, podcasts and performances"" (as well as memoir and operas in line two) is he referring to?  Even with a 3 hour workload, this seems like a great deal of class preparation.
Also in  Other required materials: on-line should be online08 Oct 2018 4:14 pm: Ron Ebert
Concur with Mickey- how will he use the six weeks? The book alone averages 70 pgs per week. The operas/ libretto alone are worth a course, and the life story may be also. Is 12 weeks a better target?08 Oct 2018 7:59 pm: Sara Freedman
Agree with comments above in terms of class organization and edits. Would also like some sense of the kinds of questions that will be pursued. Right now it seems as though the class will be going through the accomplishments of his life, sort of a time line. Other than his remarkable list of diverse occupations, what makes his life intriguing, special, worth studying? And how are you born a Jew and become a priest (not that that cannot happen, but Ron seems to just stick that in there with no explanation.)08 Oct 2018 9:00 pm: Penny Revelle
I suggest changing the 3rd (?) sentence to: The librettist for Mozart's operas Don Giovanni, Cosi Fan Tutte and the Marriage of Figaro was a fascinating character who was born a Jew in (Venice?), converted to Christianity and became a priest, and then moved to New York City.""  Don't need to say he was on the faculty at Columbia University twice.
Then I would add a final sentence about how the course will be conducted - something like ""We will watch slide presentations, hear parts of Mozart's operas and discuss Bolt's spellbinding biography.""  I don't think he has any intention of going into the librettos in any depth.08 Oct 2018 9:02 pm: Dick Rubinstein
Yes, this can be a very interesting course. I agree with all of the above concerns. Re Così fan tutte, this is the correct capitalization, I believe. Also, it needs the diacritical mark over the I in Così. A 12-week course could have a more-reasonable reading load, and could take in more of the librettos and Mozart’s music. Ron has taught 3 or more courses, so he should be open to this discussion of the course structure. With some massaging, a winner.08 Oct 2018 9:24 pm: Barbara Burr
Seems like a most intriguing subject for a study group.  I think 70 pages of reading is OK (some seminars are 100 or more) unless the book is particularly dense.  I am not so clear whether the main point of the seminar is opera or the story of this man's life...maybe it's hard to do both justice in 6 wks?  08 Oct 2018 9:25 pm: Linda Neumann
I like Penny's suggestions, except I don't think he plans many  slide presentations as he mentions in the comments.  Since probably the most interesting part of his career (from our view today) is his work on Mozart's operas,  I was expecting to see some more mention of how that happened and how they worked together .  09 Oct 2018 8:39 pm: Frank Speizer
I agree not clear if this is about the man or the making of the librettos for the 6weeks.  For both may need 12. In either case this should go well. 09 Oct 2018 11:27 pm: Helen Bakeman
Da Ponte sounds worthy of study and Penny’s suggested revisions will make the CD more inviting and clear.10 Oct 2018 9:04 am: Addison Stone
Good potential, but I agree that the current write-up leaves the reader unsure about whether the focus is on the man's life or on his writing of librettos. Either could be the sole focus of a 6-week SG. If he really wants to do both, he should say more about the librettos in the CD (what's particularly intriguing about them?), and then expand the format to 10 or 12 weeks.11 Oct 2018 5:22 pm: David Bliss
Agree with Penny's edits.  The style of the CD is engaging, but need more in13 Oct 2018 12:27 pm: Susan Harris
This sounds like a good course.  I like Penny's edits.  The CD is very short - some of the extra space should be used to 1) give a better idea of how the class will be conducted, 2) give a better idea of what the preparation will be, and 3) clarify how much of the focus is about the man vs. the operas/librettos.

Very good topic, but no way to attack all those issues in six weeks - or even 12. Could she be assisted to  narrow her scope? Perhaps think of this as the first of a series of courses on edaction policy? How about our current education secretary? That would be worth a single course.07 Oct 2018 5:26 pm: Addison Stone
I agree with Ron that this is an important topic area, but that there is too much here. The book is quite good (Nancy used it in a study group two years ago, which I was in), but it too covers a lot of territory, and, inevitably, does so a bit superficially. Agree that zeroing in on a smaller set of issues would make sense, especially for a 6-week SG (the earlier one was 12 weeks). I’m also a bit worried about Nancy’s plan to devote the first hour of each session to discussion of material from the book (which is largely organized historically) and the second hour to “contemporary issues.” How will the two segments each week be connected? Will the additional readings help to bridge the gap? Asking her to give us examples of topics (for both the first and second hours) and readings for each of two weeks would help us see how she plans to organize the material.

Not sure how to punctuate the second sentence. The third sentence “Who should decide…” is quite awkward. Sentence beginning “With teachers’ unions…” is also awkward, even after “in part by” is changed to “in part on,” as it should be. Finally, in the last sentence: one doesn’t “hear from” films, and who are the visitors? Nancy invited visitors to her earlier SG on this topic, and the link to on-going topics was meager. This would be even more of a problem with only 6 weeks to devote to the material.
07 Oct 2018 8:29 pm: Barbara Burr
I love the idea of a study group on public school education, but this one leaves my head spinning.  Maybe clarifying and focusing on some key issues such as role of the federal government vs local, how to help failing schools (issues of resource distribution etc), meeting the needs of economically disadvantaged children, what are the common demoninators of ""excellent"" schools, etc. How do we attract excellent teachers? I am not so sure about the notion we are ""special friends"" to children - everyone should be concerned about children's education.  I am certain Nancy has much to offer and can teach an excellent seminar on education.07 Oct 2018 9:00 pm: Mickey Zemon
I agree with the comments above. 
Perhaps she would consider expanding the study group to 12 weeks rather than trimming down what she wants to cover to fit into 6 weeks.
Deleting the last sentence is one good way to get rid of 13 words. It should be pretty easy to cut at least that amount from other places in the CD.
Other required materials:  This should say Other materials will be provided on the course website.07 Oct 2018 9:16 pm: Sara Freedman
I agree that there is far too much to cover in a six week course, probably even for a  12 week one. To create a stronger focus, perhaps a series of overarching questions would help: What are the connecting tissues that together might make sense of the issues as a whole? These might include who gets a say in school reform, what are the major trends in school reform, and how have these campaigns affected major constitutiences? 08 Oct 2018 8:18 am: Susan Harris
This is an interesting topic from an SGL with excellent relevant experience.  The CD lists many topics to be covered, probably too many as others have pointed out.  If the course remains 6 weeks long, it should be better focused on fewer questions.  I agree with Addison that the book discussion in the first hour and the contemporary issues discussion in the second hour should be integrated somehow (or that structure could be changed.08 Oct 2018 9:21 am: Penny Revelle
Interesting topic, but it does need to be better focused on a smaller group of issues and questions.
I think this laudry-list of a sentence could be left out without losing anything in describing the study group: ""With teachers' unions, charter schools, school shootings, cheating scandals, school closings and teachers' evaluations based in part by their students' performance on state tests, there are decisions to be made at the local, state and federal level.""
Also I wonder how films and visitors are going to be fit into a 6 week timeframe.  Maybe one visitor and one film or change to a 12 week course.  I expect Nancy has a good reason for wanting to do it in 6 weeks this second time     and asking her about it would clarify what should be included in the SG.
But basically our job, as I see it, is to help her craft a reasonable course description for the catalogue and then we should shift her over to the TLC for some mentoring on how to craft the course itself.08 Oct 2018 9:22 am: Penny Revelle
PS. I like being thought of as a ""special friend"" of the new generations.08 Oct 2018 9:54 am: David Bliss
This should be a 12-week course.  If she can only do a 6-week, she should refine the focus of the course to a few of the concepts listed in the CD.  Either way, it will be a great course.08 Oct 2018 9:01 pm: Linda Neumann
Agree that it needs more focus - even for 12 weeks the list of topics is overwhelming.  Agree with Penny that the laundry list does not add anything important to the CD.  
She talks about government action in the 60's and then in the last sentence, she returns to say we will learn how these  issues developed in the past.  I would like to see some mention of the present and the future.  Will we learn about the present, government action (or inaction) today?  What are the trends for the future?  What decisions or help should we offer to our special friends?09 Oct 2018 10:54 am: Katherine O'Connor
I agree that the topic is great but that the material to be covered seems too vast for a six-week course.  I favor a refocusing of a six-week course rather than an extending of it into a twelve-week course because the added time will not necessarily make the focus of the course more clear. 09 Oct 2018 11:16 am: Frank Speizer
Not much to add.  Grat topic, far too much for 6 weeks.  kind of like the idea of selection oof one of a series of topics to be tackled over several courses but Nancy suggests she has other ideas to join up with another SGL infuture.  Suggest we give her option to narrow the focus or extend to 12 weeks. 09 Oct 2018 11:26 am: Helen Bakeman
I too believe that as currently written there is far too much for a 6 week course.  It may need to be trimmed back even if she expands it to 10 weeks.  Focus on education and try to ignore shootings, cheating etc.09 Oct 2018 2:19 pm: Addison Stone

In the years after the Civil War Boston grappled with massive immigration from Europe, large-scale landfill projects, and substantial new construction. By 1900 it had changed from a small, ingrown community to a modern industrial city with beautiful parks, boulevards, museums, churches—and slums. We will examine the literature, art, and architecture of this new Boston, with due recognition given to its growing ethnic and religious tensions. An extraordinary generation of writers, artists, architects and philanthropists created some of Boston’s best-loved institutions, including the Museum of Fine Arts, the Boston Public Library, the Gardner Museum, Trinity Church, the Back Bay landfill project, and the Emerald Necklace. We will study these monuments to civic pride, as well as the less flattering fictional portraits of William Dean Howells, Sarah Orne Jewett, and Henry James. The SG will include two walking tours of Beacon Hill and the Back Bay.","2","","Martha","","Vicinus","","vicinus@umich.edu","617-477-4069","3 or more","","","","","","","","","","Susan Wilson|Boston Sites and Insights|Beacon|2003|","William Dean Howells|The Rise of Silas Lapham|any edition||","Henry James|The Europeans|any edition||","Course Pack|Gnomon Copy|||","Fee $20|Tours of Athenaeum and BPL|||","<strong>Readings: </strong>Susan Wilson, <em>Boston Sites and Insights</em>&nbsp;(Beacon, 2003); William Dean Howells, <em>The Rise of Silas Lapham</em>&nbsp;(any edition, ); Henry James, <em>The Europeans</em>&nbsp;(any edition, ); Course Pack, <em>Gnomon Copy</em>&nbsp;(, ); Fee $20, <em>Tours of Athenaeum and BPL</em>&nbsp;(, ).","Estimated outside work is two hours per week.

His plays epitomize the sophisticated British wit of the era between the two world wars.

We will read, view, and perform scenes from three of Coward’s most beloved works: <em>Hay Fever</em>, <em>Private Lives</em>, and <em>Blithe Spirit</em>. What do these comedies say about the artistic and social world of their time? How were they received by contemporary audiences and critics? What makes them so funny?

Wow.  I am already converted.  
Seriously, Obviously much too long.  He could (should) leave out the entire first dialogue or whatever it is.  
I think it could use a sentence about an opportunity for a serious dialogue with conservative commentary.
Second sentence (not counting opening paragraph) should be broken up.
Cut the first part of the third sentence  about being divided into four parts.
Last two sentences could be changed

Jim is a serious and articulate conservative.  Could be good06 Oct 2018 9:23 am: Dick Rubinstein
I’m all for some intelligent, anti-polarized political discussion. Yes, the “dialog” should go, in part because the CD must be a single paragraph, but I don’t think it adds much and the CD is too long. What does he mean that the discussion group is divided into four parts? Is this discussions over time, or sub-groups in each session? Note that SGL has taught one previous course (count is listed next to his name). Do we know how that course went? I’m positive on the proposal.

The fussy stuff: In the first sentence, “If there WERE living gods... WOULD sit...” I’ll let David deal with the commas.06 Oct 2018 9:45 am: Barbara Burr
I imagine Charles Krauthammer's writings and perspective could generate good and perhaps needed discussions.  I don't understand the ""four parts,"" and I think the last two sentences of the CD are annoying in various ways.  One other small matter: no one says ""psychiatric physician"" rather than psychiatrist.  Book reference is incomplete.06 Oct 2018 9:49 am: Mickey Zemon
Agree with Linda and Dick -- cut the four lines at the top.
The first sentence confuses me: If there is a living god. First, Krauthammer is no longer living;  second, if he sits atop the pantheon that suggests there are other living gods which contradicts the first part of the sentence. 
What is a psychiatric physician?  A psychiatrist?  Add a comma before  and Walter Mondale in that sentence and end it after Reaganite.  Start the next sentence with This study group will read his book, Things That Matter, ...
What is divided into four parts? Cut that sentence after “Democratic Realism.”
Delete the last sentence.
Important to have a course like this to represent a conservative perspective.06 Oct 2018 9:51 am: Mickey Zemon
Delete the last two sentences is what I meant to say06 Oct 2018 5:21 pm: Addison Stone
Jim was a valuable and productive SGM in a course I taught 2 years ago on the Opportunity Gap, which was otherwise populated by a bunch of liberals agreeing with each other. A knowledgeable, articulate, and balanced spokesperson for the conservative perspective. His first SG is not until the second half of this term, so no data there, but I suspect that he'll do reasonably well. 

Re the current proposal, I agree that it has great potential. Also agree re the need to cut the CD, most obviously by deleting the up-front dialogue, along with the last two sentences. Does he really want folks to spend only 1 hour/week reading/reflecting? Doesn't seem enough to fuel rich discussion. I haven't seen the book, but I wonder to what extent the essays will stand on their own. Any need for background readings on selected issues, and/or for contrasting position pieces?

  HOWEVER, all of these comments may be premature. Note that he says ""Not this spring."" I think he's aiming for next fall. Should clarify, and then give him suggestions for reworking the CD, and perhaps the work load.06 Oct 2018 5:33 pm: Sara Freedman
Agree with above comments. No need to give us a summary of the book or all of the highlights of K's career but rather the major questions that the book and the group will be raising and why the author is particularly adept at raising them. 
Would like sense of the nature of the course - lecture, discussion, etc.
I assume the last sentence is tongue in cheek but it doesn't appeal to me. 
06 Oct 2018 11:04 pm: Penny Revelle
Yeah, I think the dialogue has to go, but I'm not against trying to inject a little humor into political discussions, so he could put it on the class website.
The second sentence in the main paragraph could profitably be divided into 3 sentences.  
It's not clear what would be divided into four parts - the SG or the topics to be discussed.
I would leave out the last sentence.
I'm also not against a rousing discussion, but it sounds to me like the SGL means to have a knock down-drag out set of sessions with the liberals among us.  Does the SGL have plans on how he will keep things civilized?07 Oct 2018 10:36 am: Jim Whitters
as an unyielding liberal I welcome a course that at the core presents the class with a quite classic Burkean conservative's writings. I think that the sentence that begins ""Few on the left...."" could be tamed a bit by comparing Krauthammer to what is best in American political thinking and writing, conservative or liberal. I talked with Jim about the course on Wednesday at our session with possible Proposers and sensed that he is committed to a good debate but with a good dose of civility.07 Oct 2018 4:12 pm: Ron Ebert
Not much more to add- we are a good place for such a course. Hehas plenty of time to slim it down, add commas and clarify that the book has four parts- but that can be cut too.08 Oct 2018 8:50 am: Susan Harris
I applaud this effort to get people with differing political viewpoints to listen to and educate each other in a civil, maybe even enjoyable way.  It's good that the opening sentence gets across Krauthammer's lofty place among conservative commentators, but I agree with Mickey that the ""living god"" metaphor doesn't quite work.  There are also many other writing problems, mentioned above.  The last two sentences need to go if the opening dialog is dropped (as it should be).09 Oct 2018 11:14 am: Katherine O'Connor
I welcome a course on Krauthammer, but I'm critical of the paper-tiger (Goldberg and O'Donnell) opening. This implies that the critics of this ""god"" are all in the same league.09 Oct 2018 11:29 am: Frank Speizer
Not much to add in that this might be a talked about course if it were to run.  I think the CD needs major re-write.  The second sentence could be considerably shortened. and the next as others have said needs clarification. 09 Oct 2018 11:35 pm: Helen Bakeman
Great that Jim is doing this. Agree re: deleting dialogue and the reference to it in the next to last sentence.  Delete reference to book being divided into 4 parts.  When listing what the course will focus on, it would be better if he indicated this generally (foreign policy etc.) rather then citing the titles of the sections or chapter13 Oct 2018 4:42 pm: David Bliss

A few small edits to this very impressive CD:
Title - start all the words with upper case letters except for the and and.  The last word should be Works, not work
First sentence: after century, add Francis Crick so we know about whom he is talking.  Next sentence could be: How did he think, collaborate, compete, and arrive at his “Aha!” moments?
Next sentence: My goal is that the poets among us --what about all of us who are not poets?
Next to last sentence: change you can appreciate to we can appreciate.
Last sentence:  change to All questions will be encouraged.  There are no stupid questions at HILR!
05 Oct 2018 11:30 am: Sara Freedman
Agree with Mickey's editorial suggestions. Think first sentence should repeat the nature of Crick's discovery that is presented in the title: not everyone will know immediately to what he is referring. 
The course should appeal to those soles who are neither scientists nor poets - which is most of us. SGL seems extremely well qualified to give this course. I can't find if he has taught a course at HILR before. If this is his first, it seems a perfect course for him to begin as a SGL. Wonder if he will include some of the controversy about who were actually the discoverers(Rosalind Franklin, for example), as this adds interest to and important information about the nature of scientific discovery and practice at the time and into today.05 Oct 2018 12:02 pm: Ron Ebert
Wonderful idea for a course. I agree with Mickey and Sara about shortening first sentence and naming Crick. There are three sentences begining “we will”.05 Oct 2018 12:43 pm: Addison Stone
A good idea for a course, and an engaging CD. I agree with Mickey's suggestions, especially the last one. Also, the second sentence seems a bit awkward; should there be a comma after ""non-life""?  I did a double-take on the title. If you don't know that ""What Mad Pursuit"" is the name of Crick's autobiography, then it's hard to make sense of the phrasing. Would it be better to omit the title and incorporate it into the CD? In the spirit of changing ""stupid questions,"" I would omit ""science-phobes."" Begins to suggest a dumbing-down of the material.05 Oct 2018 2:52 pm: Penny Revelle
I believe this course was given once before and went very well.  I would leave ""science-phobes"" in but change the ""stupid questions"" to Mickey's wording, but that's just personal preference.  
Otherwise it looks like a great course.05 Oct 2018 4:30 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with above edits, but would be even more forceful in suggesting that Rosalind Franklin be mentioned by name and not just be part of the ""other"".  Also agree there are no stupid questions at HILR.  With edits ACCEPT05 Oct 2018 5:40 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree with edits, especially adding Watson to the title instead of the book name. (More people have probably heard of The Double Helix).  Very much would like some inclusion of Franklin.  Who are the “other autobiographies?”  Don’t want course to come across as geared to people prone to asking stupid questions!05 Oct 2018 8:01 pm: David Bliss
Lindsay Peter White gave a SG on Water, the Molecule about a year ago, which got some very good reviews.  This is another science class, but I suspect it would appeal to scientists as well as non-scientists.  He certainly has the background for it, so no need to dumb it down so much.  Besides, this is mainly a biography study group.  Is there a need for short autobiographical excerpts to be distributed if both autobiographies are required reading?  05 Oct 2018 9:20 pm: Linda Neumann
Interesting topic about how scientists operate and the process of scientific discovery.  Is Rosie Franklin one of the other contemporaries?  If so, she deserves mention in the CD.  Agree that there are no stupid questions.  
Remember, have to take the hyphen out of non-scientists.   Personally don’t like “science phobes”

The rest should be moved to “Other Preparation” (not for catalog). Above suggestions for wording are good. I agree that Rosalind Franklin should be named explicitly. Further, I’d like to see the movie be shown in a session, not as a lunch-time option, and also provide a more-critical stance in the CD on who gets the credit for the discoveries. It’ll be a good course!06 Oct 2018 9:33 am: Dick Rubinstein
P.S. The loss of the last letter “s” in the title is because the title is already the 70-character limit. An m-dash instead of space-hyphen-space will fix this.08 Oct 2018 9:03 am: Susan Harris
I agree with Mickey's edits, mentioning Crick, and removing ""science-phobes"" and ""stupid questions"".  ""Non-scientists"" sufficiently describes the intended audience.  I agree with Dick that the movie should be shown during class, not during lunch when many other activities take place at HILR.09 Oct 2018 11:21 am: Katherine O'Connor
I agree with the suggested edits and with the desirability of including a mention of Franklin. I also agree with David's question - given the required reading - about the necessity of including short autobiographical excerpts. Accept with edits.11 Oct 2018 7:37 am: Barbara Burr

To make the CD more attractive it could raise a question like ""What has happened to the American City"".  Or some other question that will be discussed in class.  She should add the interesting note in Other Prep to the course description, so that prospective members can have an idea about how the class will be run.

I think that a sentence or two  about each of the three major trends would make it a more informative CD.  Perhaps add to last sentence something like “to understand the underlying factors that caused these changes”—something that indicates what course will be looking at. Last sentence—I don’t think that we use the term “seminar.” Spacing of book is off.

Sounds like a great study group by a fairly new member who should be an excellent SGL.
I agree with David, Helen and Barbara.  She needs to round out the CD and trim the bio.
Under Other required materials she says None other than the core textbook above. 
However, under Other preparation	, she says there will be 1-3 supplementary readings including newspaper/magazine articles and selected chapters of books. An example is the introductory chapter of The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York by Robert Caro.  I think this should be moved to Other required material so it is clear that participants will be expected to read these as well.

05 Oct 2018 11:10 am: David Bliss
Another suggestion: start with ""What has happened to the American cities we all grew up in?""05 Oct 2018 11:33 am: Sara Freedman
Agree with above comments. Very bland and bureaucratic as presently written. Would include some focusing questions that can raise the reader's interest about the  focus of the course; right now seems very broad and with few case studies to anchor the discussions. Perhaps could include information about the Moses reading and others in the CD itself.05 Oct 2018 11:58 am: Ron Ebert
How can i not agree with all who proceed. Cd should be expanded, book entry corrected and bio shortened. Additional required readings should be expanded05 Oct 2018 4:39 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with all of above.  The proposer certainly has expertise to lead this study group, but clearly needs help in formulating the CD.  On the other hand we cannot write it for her.  Suggest she be encouraged to scrap what she has said and start over, with encouragement from ideas presented about.  Clearly will need re-write and another review.  05 Oct 2018 9:31 pm: Linda Neumann
Beverly is certainly qualified and articulate.  The CD needs to be rewritten.  Questions, focus, future trends, problems, regional issues.  I believe that we do not use bullets in the catalog.  Is this discussion, presentation?06 Oct 2018 10:37 pm: Penny Revelle
I don't think she needs to scrap what she has written, just use it as an outline for her real CD.
Looks like an interesting course.
We aren't including degrees in the bio any more, are we?  That would shorten the bio.  Also doesn't need to say ""before moving to MA in 2016.""
Agree other prep needs to go in other require materials section. 08 Oct 2018 9:12 am: Susan Harris
I agree with Frank that the SGL should have a second go at the CD before we review it further.  As a new member she can be forgiven for submitting a proposal that doesn't follow the guidelines or resemble other catalog CDs, but she should still do the work of fixing it.  This could be a terrific course given her background.08 Oct 2018 11:30 am: Jim Whitters
Agree with Susan and Frank in recommending a re-write of the CD. The SGL described a very attractive course in our meeting with her last Wednesday and there is no doubt, given the the SGL's vast experience that this should be a terrific course.09 Oct 2018 11:29 am: Katherine O'Connor

Fascinating topic, but first sentence is not very engaging. Perhaps start with “Why did it take so long to regulate lead?”04 Oct 2018 5:23 pm: David Bliss
To make it more engaging, he could put the two big questions at the beginning: Why did it take a long time to regulate well known poisons like lead? What was the role of industry, science and others on the process of assessing the dangers of these products? There is room for more information about the format of the course.

I agree with Ron and David.
This is a terrific idea for a study group by a very well qualified proposer.
In the bio there is a comma after his last name that should be deleted.04 Oct 2018 10:33 pm: Helen Bakeman
Agree with David’s suggested changes. This  sounds like an excellent course. There are a number of missing commas in the CD (after “danger,” after “gasoline,” ).  The first author of the book—first name should be first05 Oct 2018 9:05 am: Barbara Burr
Good course.  I think a little more on current controversy (eg the role of the EPA and the impact of politics, global agreements etc) would make it especially relevant.  The tobacco story is kind of old news (maybe except for vaping in adolescents!)...05 Oct 2018 11:40 am: Sara Freedman
Wonder about length of course given there is only one book listed, albeit one that is highly regarded and well worth reading carefully. He does mention that he will include other readings, but would like more information. Would encourage him to include some papers that deal specifically with the intersection of the environmental regulatory system and its intersection with race, ethnicity in particular. These issues were studiously avoided in a course I took with him, which made for some peculiar gaps. 05 Oct 2018 12:29 pm: Addison Stone
Great topic, from a seemingly well-qualified SGL. I agree that front-loading the two questions would add ""spark."" Looks like a simple cut-and-paste matter. The list of specific topics seems a bit long. Perhaps omit one or two items?""Second-hand smoke"" would seem to be presumed by ""tobacco smoke,"" for example. Was the SGL's previous course on a related topic? If so, might add mention in the bio. I'm not worried about SGL filling the full term; he mentions scientific papers, etc. Shouldn't ""well known"" be hyphenated when serving as a modifier? There is a documentary based on the book. I wonder if it might be worth adding. Might serve to spark  discussion about how issues are presented to the public.05 Oct 2018 5:00 pm: Frank Speizer
As much as I am against the tobacco lobby, I have to admit (and it is true for all of the hazards discussed) they were not ""... the introduction of dangerous products into use, ....  In fact the dangers for the most part were never considered in the very early days, and only with observations, for example for tobacco, starting in the post WWII period were they considered.  (In the WWI the government  handed out cigarettes to the doe boys.  For lead we can go back to antiquity.  The issues raised in the last part of the first sentence are more germane,  Agree focusing on a couple of example of why it took so long to begin to attempt to regulate would have a greater punch as the opening sentence.   I think all the information is in the CD and I agree a rearrangement is necessary except for one major issue, which might be discussed with the proposer.  The last sentence talks about the misuse of science, but what is not mentioned is how scientific certainty is used, rather than misused, to go up against industry and their lobbies.  I think this will be a great course  with modest re-write. 05 Oct 2018 10:03 pm: Linda Neumann
Opening sentence is very bland and agree that a version of the questions would improve it.  
I am not familiar with the book but my question is does this course discuss the evolution of regulatory processes, lessons learned, and have those processes been improved?  Are objective scientific conclusions  effective or are we continued to be duped and misled?06 Oct 2018 10:30 pm: Penny Revelle
How about for a title or first sentence(s) ""Are Products Innocent Until Proven Guilty? Why Does it Take so Long To Regulate Dangerous Products?
I agree that in the penultimate sentence, if science is going to be knocked as ""misleading"" and ""politicized,"" you ought to include  something about how good science can protect the public.
The list of topics in the second sentences goes on too long and will result in the readers' eyes glazing over.  Fewer would be better.09 Oct 2018 10:01 pm: Jim Whitters
Excellent course. The role of government, in legislating into action the FDA, EPA, et al. in relation to assessing the dangers of the products and then regulating them, is a critical player in the substance of the course. 12 Oct 2018 3:25 pm: Susan Harris
[Workflow note] This is a substantially edited version that is mostly responsive to reviewer comments (more interesting beginning, addition of current event topics, more info about additional readings, more detail in general, and commas added here and there).  Bob declined to add anything to the CD about race/ethnicity and eliminate ""second-hand smoke.""  He will not be showing the documentary.12 Oct 2018 3:27 pm: Susan Harris

Great improvements to an already attractive CD. I agree with Franks' concern that many of these products were not known to be dangerous when first introduced. Did you discuss altering/eliminating the phrase ""introduction of dangerous products into use"" with the SGL? Emphasis could be shifted to slow/deceptive action as evidence of dangers began to emerge. Not a deal breaker for me, but seems a bit misleading. Otherwise, seems ready to go.12 Oct 2018 5:24 pm: Sara Freedman

Could the cd be expanded to further explore “the fight for mens souls”.is the title of the third book accurately listed? 04 Oct 2018 5:06 pm: David Bliss
I love the opening quotation.  Is it a quote from a man named Nostromo, or is it a quote from the narrator? Could the CD say more about which countries  are the subject of these novels?  I found the book under the title ""Typhoon and other Tales"" It happens to contain The secret Sharer, but not in the title.
04 Oct 2018 7:06 pm: Mickey Zemon
I think the quote should begin the paragraph and not be separated by a space above it.
In the sentence starting with The Secret Agent, there should be a comma between terrorism and is.
She mentions she will be showing a film.  Is that going to take up one entire class?  If so, will there be enough time in 6 weeks to discuss the two novels and one short story?
Other Required materials: change to Other materials will be posted on the course website.
In the bio, suggest ending the sentence with moral values and deleting their challenges facing our contemporary society.  She might want to mention some of the other literature classes she has taught such as the one on Kafka.04 Oct 2018 8:14 pm: Katherine O'Connor
I agree that the quotation is wonderful but I was hoping for some kind of connect between it and the CD that follows. The works mentioned are all great; however, a more focused and less vague and general reference to each of them would be desirable.04 Oct 2018 8:47 pm: Jim Whitters
It seems that the SGL should increase the course to 12 weeks given 2 novels, one short story and one film-----is there sufficient time for full discussion in 6 weeks? Otherwise, the course is very attractive and should be popular.04 Oct 2018 10:29 pm: Helen Bakeman
It is not clear if somehow the opening quote is a theme running through all of the novels/short story..if so, that should be made explicit.  I believe that it is a quote from the book Nostromo, one of the three to be read.  Should be a comma after 20th century in first sentence of full paragraph. In addition to Mickey’s comment about bio, it should contain her first and last names.05 Oct 2018 9:01 am: Barbara Burr
I think this should be an excellent course, but worry that 6 weeks will be rushed given the many topics and ideas to discuss in Conrad's work. Could it be 12 wks with maybe an additional story?  A sentence connecting the quote to the rest of the CD would be useful.  ""Moral ambiguity"" comes up at the end, but I think related to fixed ideas, justice and danger.  Agree with edits.05 Oct 2018 11:23 am: Addison Stone
I agree about the need to connect the quote to the rest of the CD (or omit). I also think that Mimi should seriously consider expanding the length of time, perhaps to 10 weeks, especially if the film will consume an entire session. Depends a bit, of course, on how she plans to use class time. Agree with suggestion to add something in the bio re previous study groups. Is it possible to move the sentence re Secret Sharer to precede the previous sentence. I assume that it takes up some of those same themes, and placed after that statement, it seems to suggest a shift in topics that is never spelled out. Finally: commas, yes!05 Oct 2018 5:09 pm: Frank Speizer
This is likely to be a heavy, intense, lit course, by an excellent SGL. However, I agree with the several commentators that this seems to be too much material for a 6 week course (two novels, 1 short story and a film).  When she says will send out pre-readings does she mean that the books should have been read before the course begins?  This will be off putting for some.  Should encourage to 12 weeks.   05 Oct 2018 10:16 pm: Linda Neumann
The two novels are over 700 pages together. Then another story and film?  Perhaps cut out the short story or expand the course duration. The sentence about Nostromo could mention the imaginary South American country.06 Oct 2018 10:18 pm: Penny Revelle
I agree that this sounds like too much for a 6 week course.  Ten weeks would be better if we had that option this spring.  Otherwise it would have to be 12 weeks.  If Mimi is wedded to the 6 week session maybe she would delete one of the novels or the short story and film?  It might help if Mimi could decide whether she is giving a course on Conrad in general (12 weeks) or how Conrad dealt with  some subset of  the subjects: identity, love, greed, passion, justice , and the isolation of the individual within the constraints of society.(6 weeks)07 Oct 2018 3:47 pm: Sara Freedman
[Workflow note] Got rid of quote, made some edits, changed length of course and preferred time, changed title of third book and its publication date.07 Oct 2018 4:06 pm: Ron Ebert
Good rewrite, but i miss the nostromo quote. Secret sharer sentence is duhplicated.07 Oct 2018 4:37 pm: Addison Stone
Glad to see the extension to 10 weeks. Lots of editorial glitches in the CD, including a duplicated sentence, a run-on, etc. The attempt to bring The Secret Sharer more tightly into the central theme doesn’t quite work. Note that the wording of the opening sentence seems to suggest that Conrad wrote only 2 novels and 1 short story. Also, the novels are termed “political,” but the short story is not similarly characterized. I haven’t read The Secret Sharer, but I assume it too deals with political issues, so the sentence needs to read something like: “Joseph Conrad, one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, wrote two fascinating novels, Nostromo and The Secret Agent, and one short story, The Secret Sharer, that focus intensely on political issues.” Alternatively (since I don’t know Conrad’s overall output), it could be: ““Joseph Conrad, one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, focused in much of his work on political issues. In this SG, we will read two fascinating novels, Nostromo and The Secret Agent, and one short story, The Secret Sharer, that exemplify this focus.” 

Note that sentence 4 (which is repeated) doesn’t really say anything about The Secret Sharer that links it to the central theme. In the next sentence, “in” should presumably be “and.” Sentence 5 needs reworking to remove redundancy. Also, not clear why viewing the film is linked to “enquiring minds.” One minor point: Should the final sentence (about spirited dialogue) be omitted. Seems to just dangle there.
07 Oct 2018 5:43 pm: Mickey Zemon
The CD has certainly improved.  Following up on all of Addison's suggestions above will bring it over the finish line.

More than some of the film classes, this one seems to be well thought through and  focused.  I worry that 4 films in 6 wks is mostly watching and little time for discussing.  I don't know why the 2nd sentence starts with But.  I think she means that the reality doesn't always match the stereotype.  Can leave out the sentence about reading material and that would cut out works.  ""award winning"" should be hyphenated?  Bio: write out number three.  04 Oct 2018 9:32 am: Susan Harris
The CD is too long.  The course should include only comedic films or change the title.  Once I looked up ""superordinate"" I agreed with Addison's comment on creating a more cohesive package.  How long are the films?  It's hard to know how much time is available for discussion without knowing how much will be taken up with viewing.  I would like to see a list of the films in the proposal if not in the CD itself.04 Oct 2018 10:42 am: Mickey Zemon
I agree with Addison - 4 films in 6 weeks are at least 1 too many! Agree with Barbara about that second sentence that starts with But.  Could change it to: We will view view and discuss three films that reflect attitudes that have shaped Italy.
She needs to delete the first sentence of the second paragraph and merge the two paragraphs into one. Why do proposers think they can submit a CD that is more than one paragraph?  With that sentence deleted as well as the one about reading materials, the CD should be close to 150 words.
Of course, she needs to change the title so it no longer mentions tragic -- how about just Social Issues in Italian Comic Films
Why does she not assign a book on Italian film?   One hour prep time a week is scratching the bottom of the barrel. 
She should add in her bio that she has led several other study groups at HILR.  I think most of them have been on Italian film and they have been very popular and well received.
04 Oct 2018 4:24 pm: David Bliss
Three films should be sufficient to incite learning and to evoke discussion of the forces that drive Italy. It would be helpful for the committee to have a list of the three movies, and their time lengths.  Are they longer than 120 minutes?  In the past Carol has shown a movie during one session, followed by discussion during the next session.  In that case, a longer class period would not be required for every session.  SGLs should not assume that they can have an extra half hour every time.  04 Oct 2018 8:07 pm: Katherine O'Connor
Let me add to the chorus of grumbles about the second sentence beginning with ""But."" I agree with the concerns about class time being devoted to viewing more than to discussing if four films are to be shown. I feel confident, however, that Carol will address out concerns.  04 Oct 2018 10:20 pm: Helen Bakeman
Agree with the above comments about the proposal.  Although Carol has quite a good reputation as an SGL of courses on Italian literature and film, this one seems light05 Oct 2018 11:45 am: Sara Freedman
The ""but"" beginning the second sentence threw me off. Confused about whether these films reflect travelers' notions of Italy or those that have shaped Italians' understanding of their own country. Is she saying that this genre of film is particularly useful in understanding Italy? Why? I can't find the names and lengths of the various films, which would impact the amount of time available for discussion and the quality of the discussion as well. Is there an overarching question or focus that connects the four films together into a coherent whole?05 Oct 2018 5:20 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with much of above.  We certainly need titles, and length of films.  In one of her courses, which also had a book on the director that was discussed, the films were broken up and shown in two sessions, with a reasonable discussion of issues raised in the second half of the session on the film days.  Don't know if she is planning that for these comedic films.  (perhaps not if she is asking for 12:30).  Suggest more detail needs to be discussed, but of our panoply of film courses, hers have been some of the best.   05 Oct 2018 5:20 pm: Frank Speizer

I would assume she is starting at 12:30 to allow discussion time but that needs to be cleared up.  I agree that 4 films is too much for a 1/2 term course and that deleting the tragic film and changing the title would help fix that, but she could also delete one comic film and keep the tragic one and that would be a better balance of tragic/comic. and might be more what Carol has in mind for discussion.  Definitely need the film titles and the film lengths.09 Oct 2018 2:39 pm: Ron Ebert

Should be a good SG. Linda has a great style for fostering lively discussion that digs deeply into drama. The CD is nicely written but quite short, and I think more can be done to help prospective SGM’s appreciate why she chose the plays that she did. Note that the theme of “dreams” is present in lots of drama. Why these three plays? How will class time be used? Will she be screening all or parts of productions of these plays (as she did in an Ibsen SG that I took)?03 Oct 2018 11:38 am: Sara Freedman
Strong selection of plays, ones that many have read and/or seen performed over the years. Would like more discussion of the essence of the course, and agree with Addison that information about the structure of the course, whether there will be an screening of productions or class readings, etc. Perhaps open up the discussion of the ""dream,"" and what that means in the American context and how each of these plays comments on the others. 03 Oct 2018 2:00 pm: Mickey Zemon
These are three terrific plays, and Linda is truly a master study group leader.
It would be good to know if she is going to be showing scenes from these plays in class -- and mention of this would fill out the CD a little.  Another way to add to the CD is to point out that these plays were all written around the same time period but by three playwrights with very different styles, perspectives and objectives.
However, it really does not matter how long this CD is because Linda has an enormous following, and many people are going to sign up for this course.   Accept.03 Oct 2018 5:00 pm: Ron Ebert
I strongly feel the cd should be expanded. Ideas suggested above are fine, particularly why these plays, structure of class and yes, any scenes from the plays?03 Oct 2018 7:07 pm: Linda Neumann
Agree with Ron that this should be more informative.  What distinguishes each from the others?  How is the dream theme presented differently?  Screenings?  The basic information is clear and the course will probably fill, but the CD should present as much as possible within the limits.03 Oct 2018 7:35 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree with above comments.  The second sentence is a bit awkward, especially ""thematically present.""  Is the punctuation correct?  They are great plays for sure.04 Oct 2018 9:36 am: Susan Harris
The course sounds great but the CD is thin.  Beef it up along any one of the good ideas suggested above.  Since dreams are the thing that link these plays, it seems that dreams should figure in the title and/or lead sentence.04 Oct 2018 4:09 pm: David Bliss
Dreams are made or broken in these three plays. The characters all have dreams of something better. Although many members may know Linda already,  it would be helpful for new members for her to tell the motivation for choosing these three plays.  04 Oct 2018 7:18 pm: Jim Whitters
Agree with above comments that call for the CD to be expanded-----need to explain why these plays are worthy of being the subject matter of a course.04 Oct 2018 8:00 pm: Katherine O'Connor

Two-hundred works by seventy-five artists from the Busch-Reisinger Museum collection are featured. The Bauhaus, closed in 1933 by the Nazis, became the most influential school of art, architecture, and design in the world. It did away with separation of Craft from Fine Art.  Walter Gropius, founding director of the Bauhaus who joined Harvard’s Department of Architecture in 1937, gathered artists fleeing the Nazis and assembled their works in the Busch-Reisinger Museum. Included in the exhibit are Anni and Joseph Albers, Herbert Bayer, Lyonel Feininger, and László Moholy-Nagy. We will explore and discuss these works in an interactive format. Five sessions will be at the Harvard Art Museums in the third floor Special Exhibitions Galleries and one session in the Art Study Room on the fourth floor.","2","","Betty W.","","Stone","","bettyannstone@gmail.com","6174941931","3 or more","","","","","","","","","","Magdelena Droste|Bauhaus|TASCHEN, 2006, Köhn, Bauhaus-Archiv Museum Gestaltlung|2006|x","||||","","","","<strong>Readings: </strong>This edition only: Magdelena Droste, <em>Bauhaus</em>&nbsp;(TASCHEN, 2006, Köhn, Bauhaus-Archiv Museum Gestaltlung, 2006); , <em></em>&nbsp;(, ).","Estimated outside work is two hours per week.

This will be a popular art course and will certainly fill. It might be worthwhile mentioning that Harvard Art Museum's special exhibition is in honor of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Bauhaus school.  Will there be days when the class will meet at the Museum?  Or is it mostly available to see on line?  The very long sentence could be divided into two.  Also, it would be better to use active verb rather than a passive one.  Could say ""we will have access to the archives...""  if that is true.02 Oct 2018 8:29 pm: Ron Ebert
Nice idea to match this to the exhibit. Betty told me the course will take place at the museum- this should be spelled out. Edit out the three “We will....”  otherwise, it is good. Accept02 Oct 2018 8:58 pm: Linda Neumann
Betty’s courses are always in demand.  Definitely should say that course sessions are at the museum.  Agree to break up long, awkward sentence and clean up some punctuation.  Good comment by David to add 100th.  Accept03 Oct 2018 8:27 am: Addison Stone
A great idea for an SG that capitalizes on a special opportunity. I would personally like to see the addition of a book on the Bauhaus, especially if the SG time will be largely devoted to viewing exhibits. How will SGM's get the ""big picture""? If the class sessions will take place in the museum, that should definitely be stated, along with some indication of how the time in the museum will be used (mini-lectures in front of exhibits?; discussion in a museum seminar room?).

Seems like sentences 1 and 3 should be combined and placed up front. Something like, “The Bauhaus, the school of art and design founded in Germany in 1919 and shut down by the Nazis in 1933, was the site of the creative experiments in the visual arts that have profoundly shaped the world today. It brought together artists, architects and designers. We will explore their works in historical context.”

Need a comma after “design” in the next to last sentence. In the bio, “she has lead” should be “she has led.”03 Oct 2018 9:37 am: Helen Bakeman
Great idea for a SG and wonderful timing.  Agree with Addison re: combining first and third sentences.  When I read the  CD, I get a good sense of “who” but a less good sense of “what.” Could there be a sentence that describes the Bauhaus style or its approach to creativity.03 Oct 2018 11:34 am: Sara Freedman
Great idea for course, especially as it will be held at the museum and will focus on the special exhibit there. Agree this needs to be spelled out, not only because it is a plus but also because people need to know the transportation issues involved. Would like more discussion of what makes the Bauhaus school special, what was its essence and why that school was so influential during its time and continuing. Why was it shut down by the Nazis, for example? 03 Oct 2018 7:25 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree with all the above comments, especially clarifying  the venue and structure of the course, and a quick description of what is meant by Bauhaus.  This might be more useful than the long list of artists.  A concise reference  book if such exists would be a plus.  The next to last sentence is way too long.  Bio: should 8 be spelled out? Or both 8 and 11?03 Oct 2018 9:12 pm: Penny Revelle
Agree that the course taking place at the museum is vital to include in the CD. 
 I love the long list of Bauhausers but it could be shortened if some of the other suggestions were implemented, such as including more about why the Bauhaus school was important in the evolution of modern art.04 Oct 2018 8:44 am: Susan Harris
I agree that the venue must be indicated and that a brief overview text would be helpful if available.  I agree that many of the edits suggested above would improve the proposal but, aside from the spelling and punctuation edits, don't consider them mandatory.  I would especially like to see a description of what characterized the Bauhaus school -- we learn when it was founded and ended but not much else.  04 Oct 2018 7:54 pm: Katherine O'Connor
I agree with Addison's comment. I too wanted a little more info about what is signified by the Bauhaus. The listing of a lot of names associated with it doesn't illuminate what its distinguishing characteristics were. Listing the venue is obviously important given that that seems to be an important part of offering's appeal.05 Oct 2018 5:35 pm: Frank Speizer
Little more to add.  Need to indicate course at museum, and perhaps substituting a statement on Bauhaus School, rather than a list of names, which will obviously come up in the course.  Agree a book would also be useful.  07 Oct 2018 8:34 pm: Mickey Zemon

Book publisher—I think that TASCHEN 2006 is sufficient but not positive—double check with Betty.  Agree that we could delete where in the museum meetings will be held—Betty can send a note to SGMs telling them this.12 Oct 2018 8:40 am: Addison Stone
Nice improvements. Seems fine as is, but if want to shorten the CD, I agree with Sara that it’s the last sentence should be shortened.12 Oct 2018 9:43 am: Linda Neumann
Nice revision.  Agree that you can cut out the locations of the class meetings, just note that they will be in the museum.  Perhaps add of ""works of"" before the listing of artists Anni and Joseph., etc.   Question:  the Bauhaus became the most influential school...  Is it implied that this happened before it closing in 1933 or after?12 Oct 2018 9:59 am: Barbara Burr
Agree with above comments.12 Oct 2018 10:02 am: David Bliss
Excellent re-working of the proposal.  The implication is that Bauhaus  ""became the most influential school of art, architecture, and design in the world"" and continued to be even after the Nazi closure. I assume that is correct.  To make it clearer, you could say: ""has become...""12 Oct 2018 11:53 am: Ron Ebert

Another great proposal for a study group.  
The CD is very short.  Why not add some enticing questions about some of the pieces that will be studied?  At the moment it sounds like the classes are all about  listening to music and lectures. Also add to CD where and how  discussions fit into the picture.
Second sentence: twenty-year old not 20-year-old
Third sentence: Nineteenth rather than 19th?  Also need comma between composer and concentrating
Fourth sentence: Through live performances -- change to Through listening to live performances; need comma after guests and we; genius and place him -- change to genius that place him
Last sentence: need comma between requirement and class time; need comma before hopefully.  If he is not sure if he can get a distinguished guest lecturer perhaps he should leave this statement out of the CD.
Other Required materials: why would he send videos and articles by email when we have a course management system that is set up to do all that in a much better way?  Does someone need to show him how to use Canvas?02 Oct 2018 12:00 pm: Katherine O'Connor
I have taken and enjoyed Fred's Chopin course, but that said, what Mickey says the course ""sounds like"" in her second sentence is right on target.  Quite a bit of personal info about the composer plus a lot of wonderful listening but not much musicological info about what we were listening to. I didn't care because listening to Chopin was enough for me, but I think it might be disappointing to the more musically sophisticated. There are, however, others like me who don't mind sitting and basking in wonderful sound. Accept.02 Oct 2018 12:46 pm: Barbara Burr
Sounds delightful, even if light on music theory etc. Accept02 Oct 2018 2:42 pm: Sara Freedman
I too have taken several of these courses and I have enjoyed them thoroughly. I also agree with Katherine that Fred should be encouraged to include more musicological information, making sure that it is accessible to all in the class. I think that if done well, the course can be a joy to all, musicians and non musicians alike.02 Oct 2018 5:31 pm: David Bliss
Some people (Jennifer Huntington for example) have objected to the way Fred's courses are run.  There is very little SGM input other than listening .  This is clear from the description : the word discussion does not appear.  It would be nice if he could include class discussion of the book about Brahms' life, or about the musical innovations that Brahms made.  On the other hand, there should not be any false advertising if in fact, no discussion is expected.02 Oct 2018 9:12 pm: Linda Neumann
I have taken  a couple of Virginia Newes music courses which are rich in listening, musicology and biography but light in discussion.  They are a delight.  But if Fred has a different style and has enthusiastic class members - fine.  The CD seems to reflect this.  Also we have few music classes.  Go03 Oct 2018 8:12 am: Addison Stone
Definitely an Accept, but I agree with above comments about the need to be clear regarding content. I'd love to see discussion of the musical structure, and of the biographical events, etc., but if that isn't to be, then perhaps the content of the CD is accurate as it is. 

What role will the book actually play? How about inserting some mention of its role, in, for example, the sentence beginning, “Through live performances by the SGL…” This sentence could begin, “Through discussion of material in Jan Swafford’s acclaimed biography, live performances by the SGL….” 

Sentence 5 (“Through live performance….”) is quite long and a bit awkward. Suggest breading it into two sentences. Commas needed after “composer” in sentence 4, and after “guests” in sentence 5.

In the bio, I suggest cutting back a bit on Fred’s background and inserting instead something about his past SG’s.

Agree that Fred use some of the additional words available to him to outline some of the musical innovations and highlights of Brahms’ work. Agree with Addison about the bio03 Oct 2018 9:06 pm: Penny Revelle
I have taken several of Fred's courses and enjoyed them just as they were -  discussion was not promoted although questions were encouraged.   There was some musicology - sometimes offered by SGM's.  If Fred was open to the idea of more discussion and/or musicology I wonder if he wouldn't enjoy giving out some questions ahead of time that could then be discussed?04 Oct 2018 8:59 am: Susan Harris

This is a shift for Gene, who is a wonderful science instructor. He might appreciate the offer of a little help in structuring a history discussion course. The CD is much too long. Because he is associated with science mostly-lecture courses, I’d like to see something in the bio that describes his interest in this topic. Please suggest to Gene that he can help to avoid a schedule that conflicts with his course choices by checking with their SGLs and choosing different times in his preferences. With work on the CD and bio, this is a “go.""30 Sep 2018 8:46 pm: Linda Neumann
I concur with Dick that Gene has led outstanding science courses. And he certainly has participated in many discussion courses at HILR.  I expect that he can lead a good discussion.  He could remove the sentences about the duplicity among the members and the sentence about additional materials that he will supply without taking away from his main points.  After some editing, accept.30 Sep 2018 9:12 pm: Mickey Zemon
I don't want to lead a study group the same time that Gene is giving this one so I will be free to take his course!   
Second sentence: change World-wide to world-wide
Next to last sentence: change Kim Philiby to Kim Philby
Other required materials: ""A Spy Named Orphan , Roland Philips.  If this is a book, delete the quotation mark before A Spy; after Orphan delete comma and add by Roland Philips.
To eliminate over 4o words: delete There is a large body of literature on this topic, but many questions remain unanswered.  Also delete the last two sentences -- if 60-80 pages of reading should be 3 hours prep time in the Workload section of the proposal.
Gene has led at least one study group on John Le Carré's novels in the past.  He might want to mention this in his bio. Although I did not take that course, I heard it was terrific.  30 Sep 2018 9:51 pm: Barbara Burr

I agree the 4th and the last two sentence s can be cut.
Should the book listed in other required materials go into the book section with a note that the SGL will provide sections to be read on the course site?
Then part of the second to last sentence --""The SGL will provide other relevant material.""  could go into the other required materials section (with maybe a hint of what that would be.)
I too would like to see a sentence in the bio about why he's switching from his focus on science here.  Sometimes what a person chooses is an interesting insight into how they think.01 Oct 2018 1:09 pm: Helen Bakeman
194 words—I think that the 2nd and 3rd sentences could be deleted, or combined into a shorter sentence.  I think that the 4th sentence with revisions is important—something like “while much is known about how this group operated, many’s questions remain unanswered. If he says the number of hours (3), should number off pages be delete? In second do last sentence, Ring should not have a capital R. He says that there will be two books but only one is listed—where is other one?  Or is that what is listed in handouts?  Not clear.

I suppose this must be an exception to our style sheet.  Both the title and the first line contain the cardinal number 5 instead of five.  OK, this time I can let it go. There is confusion about the second book. It is written by Roland Phillips, not by a Russian KGB agent.  The Bio should name his interest in the field of spy novels.01 Oct 2018 5:05 pm: Katherine O'Connor

Agree that this is an intriguing topic. Adding mention of previous SG on Le Carre in the Bio should address the concern re a switch of topics. Suggested deletions and edits should fix the CD.

[Workflow note] Edits based upon further description of course from the SGL have been made and now ready for further discussion.03 Oct 2018 8:36 am: Addison Stone
The book mystery has just gotten more mysterious for me. The CD still says that there will be two books, one of which is written by the KGB handler, but the newly added second book is not that book. Instead, the KGB book is now listed under Other Required Materials. So, are there three books? Need to reconcile.

Various earlier suggestions for shortening the still apparently untouched CD need to be implemented.

This sounds like a wonderful course and the CD, though ridiculously over the word limit, is very compelling.  Agree with various suggestions above for shortening.  In addition to Mickey's edits, I would de-capitalize ""Gentlemen"" in the first sentence.  I could see ""Cambridge 5"" as an exception to the style rule for numbers if that were how the group is normally referred to, but ""Cambridge Five"" seemed more common in my quick perusal of web sites.  But that's minor.  Accept after editing for length and correcting minor punctuation errors.08 Oct 2018 9:38 pm: Jim Whitters

Today’s stories by Irish writers reflect the changing social, political and personal landscape of this small island nation that has produced a remarkable number of great writers. Many of us are familiar with the short stories of James Joyce and William Trevor, but there are many more Irish short story writers who should be read and appreciated. This study group will explore short stories from the last half of the twentieth century to the present by contemporary authors, such as Mary Lavin, Dermot Bolger, Ann Enright, John McGahern, and many more. Study group members will be expected to read each story closely and to discuss, analyze and enjoy these tales of emigration, humor, suffering, change and loneliness.

I think this can be a good course.  I wonder if the 2 hour preparation estimate is right. Since Eileen is a long-time member, but has only taught one course previously, I suggest a little conversation about the structure of the course. She names 5 stories and says there are others, plus what I take to be an essay by Frank O’Connor (not to be included in the catalog listing). Is it one story a week, or more than that?  The proposal also needs a lot of little edits, which I’m sure Helen can take care of without my detailing them. 30 Sep 2018 8:47 pm: Mickey Zemon
I agree with Dick.  Cannot resist a few little edits below:
Second sentence: story-telling history, the quotation marks around tale need to be fixed.
Third sentence: space before first word Most
Fourth sentence: Masters of the Short Story - why upper case letters?  If caps are from Enright then perhaps these words should be between quotation marks.
Fifth sentence: including stories - change to including those since stories mentioned earlier in sentence
Last line: their (not your) reaction to (to is missing)30 Sep 2018 9:05 pm: Linda Neumann
Aside from the ""little edits"", the CD is clear and should attract a good audience.  She notes that she would like some advice on how many stories to assign per week.   Who should advise?  Is it the TLC?30 Sep 2018 9:39 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree with edits.  Is there some way tO characterize what makes Irish short stories disrinctive?   A good topic.30 Sep 2018 9:56 pm: Ron Ebert
Nice idea for course- with edits, accept. Hellen might be able to begin a  discussion of  the structure of the course and number of stories and refer her to teaching and learning for more assistance.30 Sep 2018 10:10 pm: Penny Revelle
Good topic and enticing study group.  Just to make it a little more enticing I would rework the second to last sentence so it is doesn't sound so forbiddingly schoolmarmish.  Maybe: ""SGMs will read the stories closely and then have a chance during the SG to discuss and criticize them.""
As for how many stories per week I would think it depends on their length.  If the workload is two hours per week that might translate into 60-80 pages per week and then however many stories fit into that many pages.
Take out the partial sentence at the end: ""Reading about 50-60 per week.""01 Oct 2018 12:01 pm: David Bliss
I like the format of the class.  But there are two titles.  One of them would suffice;  I prefer the second one. She probably plans to do more than one story per class, so a two-hour reading assignment would cover that.01 Oct 2018 2:29 pm: Jim Whitters
Attractive course. Clarification needed regarding reading per week in terms of stories and/or pages.01 Oct 2018 5:28 pm: Katherine O'Connor
I agree that two course titles are not needed, and I would opt for the second choice. Agree with Mickey's edits. There are a lot of great Irish short stories, and the Frank O'Connor book is excellent for any course on the short story. I think that the CD should give some more specific indication as to why the stories of these particular Irish authors are great. Accept with edits.01 Oct 2018 6:28 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with much of above.  One title is sufficient.  Other edits as suggested.  It is not clear to me whether we need to give estimated pages a week or just homework time.  In this case might be better to say 2-3 stories/week and 3 hour prep, rather than 6080 pages. ACCEPT with edits. 02 Oct 2018 8:40 am: Addison Stone
Seems like a good focus for an SG, but I agree with others about the need to pick only one title. The second seems better. The CD seems generally fine, though it seems a bit odd to emphasize the shift to English in the mid 19th C and then announce without explanation that the SG will focus on the late 20th C. Either eliminate the specific reference to 19th C and/or say something about decision to focus on recent stories? I also wonder about singling out the novella in the final sentence. I would cut that and use the words to address my preceding comment. Some possible edits: In the second sentence, hyphenate “story telling.” Also, that same sentence might read better if the second clause were marked more explicitly. So, “…long and robust, and it gave rise….” I would not capitalize “Masters of the Short Story.” Need a comma before “and others” in third sentence from the end. Finally, in the next to last sentence, the juxtaposition of the singular “reaction” and plural “criticisms” is a bit awkward. What about simple “your reactions to each story.”02 Oct 2018 2:47 pm: Sara Freedman
Members seem to be attracted to Irish literature, for good reason. I agree with the suggestions above - use only the second title, make the grammatical and stylistic changes, and perhaps give some sense of why this literature is distinctive and enticing. Right now, CD reads a little bland.04 Oct 2018 12:48 pm: Susan Harris
I like Penny's revision of the second to last sentence.  It was both grammatically incorrect (the missing ""to"") and boring.  I agree with Mickey's edits.  I prefer the second title.  Accept with edits.13 Oct 2018 1:02 pm: Helen Bakeman

Fascinating topic, although I do not understand the word ""touching"" in the title.  Does it mean ""understanding""? Also, I think the cycle of four novels should be lower case. The title is The Sea of Fertility and it should be italicised.01 Oct 2018 1:14 pm: Helen Bakeman

Great idea, compelling proposal.  I agree that any of the three suggested sentences can be eliminated to shorten the CD (""Death and loss..."", ""We can all be grateful..."", and ""I had a wonderful time..."").  I would probably take out the first because it's obvious and the third because it's too informal and includes language that could be moved to the bio.

Nice concise CD featuring an intriguing thesis and a good book.
I would accept29 Sep 2018 9:53 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree, CDStraight forward and should attract interested crowd. Wonder whether some suggestion about how geography relate to international politics might be raised as query that if SGLs are planning to explore could be mentioned. ACCEPT 29 Sep 2018 10:29 pm: Mickey Zemon
This is an excellent CD and terrific topic.
""lastly taught history"" in the bio of the first SGL might be changed to ""most recently taught"" or just ""taught"" or a professor or instructor of history.30 Sep 2018 8:51 am: Addison Stone
Agree that this is a compelling topic, and that the CD is nicely constructed to convey the issue and spark interest. I wonder, however, if they are biting off a bit too much for a 6-week SG. Should they cut back on the number of topics/areas to be covered? I see that their list of topics aligns with the book chapters, which are short, so maybe okay, but I worry a bit about superficiality. The third sentence needs a comma after ""today,"" and the last sentence needs a comma after ""hours."" I like comma's, so I would also put one after ""Marshall"" in the penultimate sentence.30 Sep 2018 9:42 am: Barbara Burr
A fine topic.  Don't need the last sentence, so with some extra word allowance, I would make the 3rd sentence a bit more specific as opposed to vague general statements (eg how ""modern technology may be affecting the future"" - it obviously is, so how does this relate to geopolitical issues...).  Also, at some point I would refer to the full title of the book: Prisoners of Geography: Ten Maps That Explain Everything About The World.  Reviews I read were middling.30 Sep 2018 11:29 am: David Bliss
This course would appeal to geopolitics junkies if there are any.  After the first series of questions, it might be to suggest an answer: ""They might be prisoners of their geographical location"".  The CD should make clear that the book title is about the world maps, and it is a New York Times best-seller.30 Sep 2018 3:17 pm: Jim Whitters
the first time that I read the CD I thought it was much too much for a 6 week course but upon re-reading it I found it to be a topic that does cover much ground but very doable as I understand the SGL's further discussion in the ""Further information"" section. Accept 30 Sep 2018 6:25 pm: Sara Freedman
Good course description with thoughtful accompanying questions. It does seem to be a topic worthy of a full semester. I'm wondering if they would consider adding an additional book that would more time and perhaps a different perspective on the topic.30 Sep 2018 8:57 pm: Linda Neumann
An engaging and different topic.  Agree with above that the material could easily be a full term or 10 week course. Perhaps they would be willing to extend the course.  Tibet is not a ""tiny"" country.30 Sep 2018 9:48 pm: Ron Ebert
I like david’s suggestion adding sentence to clarify their goal. It does seem as if it might be a full semester course, otherwise they might seem to be rushing through their meaty topics.01 Oct 2018 1:21 pm: Helen Bakeman
Good idea for a course.  Neither of the last 2 sentences is necessary—they repeat information that is given elsewhere.  That gives them additional space to raise other issues that will be discussed in class such as goals, most critical 21st century geopolitical issues.  Agree that they should be encouraged to extend to 10 weeks.01 Oct 2018 7:54 pm: Katherine O'Connor
Topic will be appealing to many, I imagine, but I agree with Addison's reservation that six weeks seems inadequate for what they are promising. (I can't say or hear in my mind the adjective 'geopolitical' without thinking of Henry Kissinger!) Accept.04 Oct 2018 1:22 pm: Susan Harris

The three movies I have chosen from my course, have been among our most popular. We brought back Walk on Water (2004) and Live and Become (2005) for our 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary retrospective this year.  Sand Storm is contemporary but tells the story of how indigenous tribes within a larger more uniform culture suffer

Show Live and Become at first class - reading material on Ethiopian Jews for the 2nd class with possibly a speaker.

3rd class would show Walk on Water and 4th would discuss it. The themes in Walk on Water speak for themselves and I believe discussion would be interesting in the 4th class

Sand Storm is the shortest film so there would be discussion directly after. Some reading material in preparation.

6th class will deal with the immigration in the 90s of the Jews from the Former USSR as they were highly educated PhDs and technicians so its a contrast with the Ethiopian immigration and Start up Nation has good information on this that would be read before this class.  Modern problems Israel in particular internally with articles about the Bedouins (Sand Storm) and Druze  tribes and those seeking work in Israel from  the Sudan and Eritria are ripe for discussion. Then what about looking at China and their Uighur population which is under threat.

I assume basic knowledge about the history of Israel and the current politics.  A basic popular book was Ari Shavit: My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel if someone wanted background. Start Up Nation is mainly about Israel's development of technology and its entrepreneurship.","29 Sep 2018 2:13 pm: Mickey Zemon
I think this would be a very appealing and thought-provoking study group.
If the 6th session is going to deal with the immigration in the 90s of the Jews from the Former USSR (see Further Information above) then perhaps she needs to add a fourth question something like: How did the immigration of the Jews from the former USSR in the 1990s differ from the experience of other immigrant groups?  I do not know if Former or former USSR is correct.
I suggest not putting the names of the films in parenthesis after the questions.  Instead I would include them in the last sentence with a rewrite that goes something like this: We will gain insights into these issues by viewing three films -- Live and Become, Walk on Water, and Sand Storm, reading sections of  Start Up Nation and other selected sources, and listening to guest lecturers.  Our discussions will focus on understanding the trials and tribulations of those coming (add ""to"") and those within the nation of Israel.  I would eliminate: and so can we gain greater insight to struggles of peoples in our larger world.
She needs to trim the bio.29 Sep 2018 4:21 pm: Sara Freedman
I agree that the topic is appealing and could elicit a thought provoking study group. I particularly like Sand Storm as it deals with issues that are central to many Israelis today, and are widely discussed and debated within the general population.
I have a  number of questions/comments:
I believe it is important to include the laws of Israel concerning immigration: The Law of the Return and more very recent Law on the Jewish Nation. Without this legal and historical background, it is hard to understand Israel's stance on immigration. 
I am not sure how Live and Become is central to the core issues of immigration and identity within Israel. It seems to be a thoughtful film on an important topic, but not one in which immigration or identity are central.
There are films about African migrants to Israel, whose fate as aliens within the culture is quite bleak and contested. Could they be considered for such a course? Many in Israel see their situation as emblematic of the major contradictions within Israel about immigration - shunning Africans while embracing Russians, many of whom are not Jews but do bolster the white, highly educated population in Israel. 
29 Sep 2018 4:22 pm: Penny Revelle
Great ideas but I think it needs a serious rewrite.  There needs to be a first sentence explaining that 3 films  a book and a variety of materials posted on the website will be use to explore how immigrants, descendants of immigrants and indigenous peoples ---  well I'm not sure how to finish this sentence because I'm to sure there is an overriding goal stated in this course proposal.  The SGL needs to think about what she wants to explore - how immigrants and indigenous peoples integrate into Israeli society, what special angst do descendants of Nazi's suffer or something else.  It's too all-over-the-place right now.  Maybe she wants to look at the diversity of Israeli citizens and how they are going to get along to run the country.  If so she needs to have something on the Palestinians in there, but then it should be a 12 week course.
If she wants to remain within a 6 week time frame, I suggest she use only one or at most two of the films suggested.
Also she'll seriously decrease her target audience if she only wants people who have knowledge of Israeli history and  current politics - but maybe that's the intention.  Another way to go would be to have some class and reading time devoted to, at least, current politics if not history.29 Sep 2018 10:03 pm: Frank Speizer
I agree fully with Penny. Need get the idea that this is a short film course in first sentence and also agree that cannot limit Course to those with working knowledge of Israeli immigration. Thematic questions of what this course will cove also needs to be included. Suggest discuss and full re-write30 Sep 2018 6:42 am: Barbara Burr
Agree with Penny.  Seems overly inclusive for 6wks.  Required reading can say there will be articles provided on a variety of  retopics30 Sep 2018 6:47 am: Barbara Burr
(Sorry above got posted too soon!) ...a variety of relevant topics. Needs sharper focus re most important themes. Bio a problem.30 Sep 2018 11:06 am: David Bliss
Very interesting topic.  But the CD needs to explain the format of the course.  Starting with a poignant question is a good idea, but the next series of questions does not give information about how the course will be run.  The Bio is way too long.  It should be focused on what she has done relative to the course content. Has she led discussions on these films before?30 Sep 2018 12:44 pm: Jim Whitters
I concur with Barbara-----very compelling topic that should result in a superb course----overall the CD needs to be harnessed so that there is more clarity for those who are contemplating taking the course.30 Sep 2018 9:35 pm: Linda Neumann
 The topic is fascinating and the Israeli population probably experiences more religious, ethnic, generational, racial,  economic, political, and assimilation issues per capita than any country in the world.  

Agree with Penny that this needs to be rewritten.  First of all, to tell us that it is a film course and not include the film titles in parenthesis.  Perhaps add that she will be providing some background material (on immigration, Bedouins) in order to understand the context of the films.  She should not assume that interested members are familiar with the situation in Israel.

Agree with Sara that two of the major conflicts involve the historical power of the  European Jews  and the immigration of over 1 million Jews (and non Jews) from the USSR and subsequent republics since the 1970's.  However, she has chosen other topics and  in  six weeks she can't cover everything.

Bio needs serious pruning.30 Sep 2018 9:41 pm: Ron Ebert
Well, all has been said and i concurr with rewrite. Also 3 films, one book and nineteen required articles AND a speaker in six weeks? Some more thought needs to be given to how all of this will fit together. Yes bio needs rewrite and degrees should be dropped.01 Oct 2018 1:30 pm: Helen Bakeman
Great idea for a study group and needs major rewrite work on CD and Bio.  I agree with Penny’s comments, and also Sarah suggestion of setting this within the standards set by Israeli law01 Oct 2018 8:14 pm: Katherine O'Connor
The CD is too diffuse. I agree that if films and materials about immigration and integration are the focus of the course then Sara's suggestion about including the relevant Israeli laws is important; however, the films selected seem not to have this specific focus. Given Barbara's familiarity with Israeli films, maybe she should consider giving a course on what she considers to be the greatest recent Israeli films and why.","false","","96","2018-09-28 22:30:50","https://ccsubmit.com/","","","","","","Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/69.0.3497.100 Safari/537.36","73.47.61.242","","complete","complete","","","pending","","","","","","","pending","13","1538242573"

Could be a good course.  As Barbara said, needs careful editing to clean up random issues.  He could take out the sentence about Napoleon as a caricature - it would read more smoothly and the point is not necessary.
Change the bit about reading being ""encouraged.""  The book is required.
It seems to be mostly a lecture course - perhaps indicate 50-50 lecture, discussion is that is so.
I would take out the real estate developer part of bio.01 Oct 2018 1:44 pm: Helen Bakeman
Great topic but I end up not being at all clear exactly what he wants to cover and how. He wants to cover NB’s full bio and history of Europe with a focus on war.  Is Bonaparte symbolic/representative of what happened in Europe? Caused it? It also sounds a bit like SGMs should read the book (248 pages in 12 weeks and nothing else in particular) and then sit back and watch the slide show and listen, I am perhaps overstating this but that is what it sounds like.  I think that there needs to be an up-front conversation with Willy about these issues and then some rewriting. Has he done other study groups and, if so, how were they received?01 Oct 2018 1:49 pm: Ron Ebert
Perhaps start with the sentence “Most Americans have heard of Napoleon...” and when were the royal houses trying to prevent democratic ideas spreading? With some of the edits suggested above and shortening, should be fine. Willy tends to show slides and lecture. He might benefit from some assistance encouraging discussion.01 Oct 2018 2:19 pm: Mickey Zemon
I agree with Helen about not being clear about what he wants to cover and how.  I found his best explanation of this expressed in the Further information section: The purpose of the course is to understand the end of royal rule, the beginnings of democracy in Europe, and why war seems to be a necessity of civilization which continues today.  I would add as the first purpose ""to understand the rise and fall of Bonaparte."" I suggest deleting the last two sentences in the CD and replacing them with this one.  Another sentence that could be deleted is: Most Americans have heard of Napoleon, but in the USA he is mostly a caricature. Also: Napoleon did meet his Waterloo at Waterloo, but his history is poorly known.  Also: the one about most Americans that Ron mentions above.This should trim the CD down to about 150 words.
Need a clearer statement about what ""a visual presentation course with discussion and reading encouraged"" means.
First sentence: Napoleon with  u/c N; Anglo-American demon or French hero
Second sentence:  start this sentence and others with u/c letter; monarchy -- or was he both?  delete the semi-colon
Fifth sentence: troubled; a story of victories and defeats -- change to troubled and full of victories and defeats.
Other required materials: delete Group members may use other books or any other helpful information including the internet, but no additional materials will be required.


01 Oct 2018 2:21 pm: Jim Whitters
The subject should make for an interesting course. However, the CD needs to be reorganized so that the SGL is clear as to what direction he wants to take the course. I recommend a complete re-write for he sake of clarification and focus.01 Oct 2018 5:29 pm: Addison Stone
I think I just lost all of my comments, so I'll start again. Apologies if this is a duplication. I agree with others re the need to rework this CD. Some re-ordering of sentences and deleting of extraneous comments. Also, I agree re need to add caps and commas to what remains. It sounds like this is basically a lecture course with rich visual supports. So, what is the role of the book? Also, the book is over 50 years old (originally published in 1963), and there are more recent biographies that have received praise, so why this one? Finally, like Helen, I wonder about how the SGL will move from the narrow focus on Napoleon to the MUCH broader topic of the role of war in human history. If the latter is really going to be a significant part of the SG, shouldn't there be some readings on that broader topic?01 Oct 2018 8:24 pm: Katherine O'Connor
The CD really needs to be worked over and put in clearer focus. I didn't know that Napoleon was viewed as a demon by Americans. It was hard for me to read this CD without thinking of the Russian view of him as a kind of anti-Christ. Also, War and Peace is, among other things, a diatribe against Napoleon. I can't believe he was more of a demon to us than he was to the Russians, but I may be flaunting my ignorance here! 02 Oct 2018 2:54 pm: Sara Freedman
CD seems somewhat wandering. Not sure if a focus on Napoleon and his historical impact can be easily included in a discussion of the role of war in the making of history. Would like clarity on the integration of the two. Will Napoleon's history be a case study of something about history? If so, what?

Also, agree that book is very old. There are more recent and highly regarded biographies. Why not use one of these in a 12 week course, and make sure the course discusses this reading?

Needs more description of what he means by ""visual course."" Are we sitting back and looking at pictures while the SGL lectures?03 Oct 2018 2:01 pm: Susan Harris
I agree with Linda that this could be a good course, and I also agree with Jim that the proposal needs a complete rewrite after a few things have been decided:  
-What is the primary purpose of the course - to understand Napoleon or to understand why humans go to war?  It sounds like he wants to do both but the latter topic is a very big one and there is no indication of how it will be approached.  
-Is this the best book and how will it (or another) be integrated into the course?
And one minor comment -- to me a British demon is a demon who was born in Britain, not someone the British consider a demon.05 Oct 2018 6:22 pm: Frank Speizer
I agree with Helen and even before consider re-write of CD need a discussion about what this course is.  Although the word discussion does appear in the CD it really sounds like it is designed as a lecture course with slides.  The topic, I agree could be fascinating, but it could also be a very dull history lecture course of battle to battle.  David has his work cut out.  08 Oct 2018 9:29 am: Penny Revelle
I think a course focusing on Napoleon is an excellent idea, but to get into why people fight wars is a whole other topic and would deserve a course of its own, so I would leave out ""-----and at the necessity or insanity of war. the course will also discuss and examine why people who do not know and have no personal conflicts with each other, are willing to kill each other in battle.""
I wouldn't recommend this course for the lecture room on the 2nd floor - it needs discussion and that room doesn't stimulate discussion.","false","","95","2018-09-28 18:01:12","https://ccsubmit.com/","","","","","","Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/69.0.3497.100 Safari/537.36","24.218.130.38","","complete","complete","","","pending","","","","","","","pending","13","1538400431"

In compelling recent fiction, we will watch, among others, a young couple struggling to start life together while fleeing civil war, a New York hospital pharmacist returning to Manila to assist his mother and dying father, a young Vietnamese man leaving his parents near Saigon for 1974 San Francisco, and a retired German intellectual trying to understand and help a group of African men in a makeshift detention center near Berlin. Both émigrés and caretakers face ethical dilemmas, physical danger, and confusion about personal choices, offering us opportunities to broaden our perspectives on newcomers and our responses to them.

As usual, a well thought out course proposal from John Morrel.  The only change I would like to see is a more stirring opening sentence.  Toni Morrison's quote is apropos but dry.  Maybe something about the headlines and pictures of migrants in small boats, that wring our hearts, or about the pictures of refugees backed up at our own southern borders.  I realize John is intending to look at the broader topic and include stories of people who choose to migrate rather than just those who are forced to move, but as the man who first slugs his donkey with a 2 by 4 and then trains him with kindness explains, ""First you gotta get their attention.""27 Sep 2018 1:58 pm: Mickey Zemon
Sounds like an excellent proposal to me.  In the third sentence, I would suggest separating the clauses with commas rather than semi-colons since they all relate back to the subject and verb ""we will watch.""  Also, maybe at the end of  that sentence ""and others"" could be dropped since the sentence is just giving a taste of of what will be done.  Accept.27 Sep 2018 4:12 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree the first sentence could use reworking.  Much as I love Toni Morrison's writing, ""the spectacle of mass movement"" feels kind of vague and overly general, especially as the SG will focus on very particular stories.  Maybe a quote from one of the books?  ""And others"" not needed or needs explaining.  Good course!27 Sep 2018 4:36 pm: Helen Bakeman
Excellent proposal for a fascinating study group. Agree with Mickey’s comments and also with Penny re: first sentence.  John has indicated number of pages of reading per week as well as hours...I thought that we were not going to do that...need to clarify.27 Sep 2018 5:48 pm: Katherine O'Connor
I agree with the comments related to the opening of the description, and I was, in fact, misled by Morrison's reference to ""the spectacle of mass movement"" since what follows in the CD makes it clear that John is talking about the difficulties and challenges of leaving home in a broader context. It also occurred to me that leaving home must be much easier for some than for others; so is the act of leaving home necessarily always a fiction?  I think, however, that the topic of leaving home and what that means for different people in different circumstances is a wonderful topic in itself with a lot of appeal.  27 Sep 2018 7:22 pm: Frank Speizer
Excellent topic and well thought out..  in second sentence the phrase  “who choose to leave home behind, and those who have no choice” seems awkward  in that no choice to stay.? Or to leave?    The “1974” seems misplaced. ACCEPT 28 Sep 2018 8:08 am: Addison Stone
Agree that this sounds like a compelling SG topic. Nice range of readings. I'm actually okay with the opening sentence. Though the readings seem to zero in on the stories of particular individuals, at least two of the stories take place within the context of mass movements of people. Agree that the semi-colons might be changed to commas, and that ""and others"" is unnecessary. Is the workload really 3 hours? Shouldn't take that long to read 55-65 pages and ponder a few questions. Is there more work involved, or should this be 2 hours?28 Sep 2018 12:56 pm: David Bliss
What the CD describes is mass migration on an individual scale.  ""Mass movements"" to me describes a social phenomenon.  Except for the first sentence, the CD is clear, however the long series of examples would be better if they were all in the same tense.  Make them present indicative: ""returning"" ""leaving"" ""trying"".29 Sep 2018 8:57 am: Susan Harris
I agree with: 
- this is a good topic and proposal
-improving first sentence (will work with John on that)
-replacing semi-colons with commas (as suggested by Mickey)
-""those who had no choice"" is awkward - suggest changing to ""those who were forced to.""
-making tenses consistent (as suggested by David)
-deleting reading pages
I think the following are OK as written:
-1974, used as an adjective to describe San Francisco
-""and others"".  I'm in the minority here, but if you take that phrase out the list can be read as complete when it isn't.
-""fiction"" -- it refers to the genre of reading, not to the experience of leaving29 Sep 2018 4:10 pm: Sara Freedman
Kudos for John for submitting another timely, thought provoking course with a strong and diverse group of authors. Agree with first sentence could be more compelling as well as more reflective of the course itself. The books seem to focus on individual life stories, albeit ones that have been greatly affected by larger geopolitical tensions throughout the world. Would like an explicit mention of how the course will deal with the interplay of the personal with the larger political context. Sounds like a wonderful course, and knowing John as a teacher, should be well subscribed and well taught.30 Sep 2018 12:14 pm: Jim Whitters
Concur with Susan's summary and with those changes----accept.30 Sep 2018 9:36 pm: Ron Ebert
Yes a stronger first sentence is a good idea and current thoughts of immigration come to mind. Very good course topic by very experienced sgl. Accept30 Sep 2018 9:58 pm: Linda Neumann
I actually like the first sentence.  It conveys the enormity of the phenomenon and the attending idea of uprooting.  Then John converges on the individuals and their stories.  Undoubtedly will be a will attended and thoughtful course.  Accept with minor edits.04 Oct 2018 9:15 am: Susan Harris
[Workflow note] No changes made yet.  Working with SGL.04 Oct 2018 2:12 pm: Susan Harris
[Workflow note] I have edited the CD to address the grammar and punctuation comments raised by CC members.  I discussed the opening sentence with John and he feels strongly that he wants to keep it as is for a number of reasons including its familiarity to the 20 people who took a recent course of his and are likely to be among those interested in this one.  I think we should respect his wishes in this  regard, especially as the course is likely to be popular anyway.  He also feels that 3 hours is the correct amount of time needed for the thorough reading of assigned materials that he will expect from SGMs.04 Oct 2018 2:15 pm: Susan Harris
[Workflow note] Is the sentence fragment at the end OK?  I don't know what our rule is on that.","true","","94","2018-09-27 09:44:21","https://ccsubmit.com/","","","","","","Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:62.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/62.0","205.201.22.21","","complete","complete","","","approved","complete","","approved","complete","complete","pending","pending","11","1539453523"

Below is the Extended Description that I will post on the course website:

The novels for this Study Group were not selected at random. When the United States entered the <u>Vietnam</u> conflict, our government was intervening in a foreign country, at first secretly, then openly, attempting to force an outcome viewed as favorable to US strategic interests, namely, restricting the expansion of Russian and/or Chinese communism. When Timothy McVeigh detonated a huge bomb in Oklahoma City, destroying a courthouse and killing hundreds of its occupants, it was the terrorist act of an isolated home-grown <u>anarchist </u>– a direct attack against the government, its properties, its employees and, incidentally, ordinary citizens going about their normal business. When the Taliban orchestrated and executed the intricate attacks of 9/11, a complex act of terrorism against some of the most prominent symbols of the United States, with utter disregard for, indeed, with scorn for the lives of the many people killed, the United States shifted its attention to the <u>Middle East</u> and not only attacked the Taliban in Afghanistan but also carried out an unprovoked invasion of Iraq.  What has followed has been a continuing conflict against one type of insurgency or another, involving both overt and covert warfare, with a mixed degree of disregard for national boundaries and the sovereignty of foreign governments. The threat of terrorism, by individual lone wolves, by insurgent groups, and even by national governments, has become a large component of our daily awareness. It is an important part of current political discourse and colors the debate over the meaning of the welcoming message that is boldly displayed on the Statue of Liberty.

With so many real terrorists around, why study “fictional terrorists”? Actually, novelists have long been intrigued by the emotional and psychological stress that terror invokes. By focusing on individual characters and their stories as created by gifted authors, we can gain insights into the terrorist milieu that complement what we can learn from the grisly stories in daily newspapers and on television. Taken together, the three novels we will study provide a kaleidoscopic view of terrorists and terrorism and the impact they can have on individual lives and society as a whole. We also get the benefit of reading some pretty amazing writers.

The three novels span a full century: <em>The Secret Agent</em> by Joseph Conrad (1907), about <u>anarchists</u> in London and their manipulation by an interfering foreign government; <em>The Quiet American</em> by Graham Greene (1955), about the American intervention in <u>Vietnam</u> prior to the French defeat; <em>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</em> (2007) by Mohsin Hamid, addressing the modern <u>Middle East</u>, albeit in the microcosm of two specific characters in a situation that is presented obliquely. Along the way, we will also view the excellent film adaptation of <em>The Quiet American</em> starring Michael Caine.

This Study Group will be discussion-centric. We will take a multi-faceted look at the three works, spending part of the discussion on the writing, the story structure, the character development, and the degree of reader engagement the author is able to create. We will also address the characteristics of terrorists as represented in these novels, seeking whatever commonality we can find among the three works.  Expect 2-3 hours/week of engaging reading.

I would prefer to take up the three works chronologically, but because <em>The Secret Agent </em>is too long to be read in two weeks, we will start with <em>The Quiet American. </em>An outline of our syllabus is given below:

1: First half of <em>The Quiet American</em>

2: Completion of <em>The Quiet American</em>

3: View and discuss film of <em>The Quiet American</em>; read first third of <em>The Secret Agent</em>

4: Second third of <em>The Secret Agent</em>

5: Completion of <em>The Secret Agent</em>

6: <em>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</em>","25 Sep 2018 4:32 pm: Mickey Zemon
I think he could improve on the first sentence; under Further Information he says --With so many real terrorists around, why study “fictional terrorists”? That seems more like a grabber first sentence to me.  He could then start the second sentence, To answer this question, we shall read . . .
He needs to separate the descriptions of the three books with commas not periods since they follow a colon.
Hamid’s The Reluctant Fundamentalist moves us -- suggest changing moves to transports 
Move the sentence about writing style to before the sentence on viewing the film since it directly relates to  the previous sentence about the three books.
Last sentence: change terror to terrorism -- not all terror is from terrorism.
Reading these three novels in 6 weeks is lots of reading.  It is too bad that there will be only one class session to discuss The Reluctant Fundamentalist.  Maybe the students could watch the film on their own outside class and he could use the session this frees up for a second class discussion of that novel.
25 Sep 2018 7:15 pm: Frank Speizer
There is not much to fault for this experienced SGL who has done this before, albeit, in a different genre. I think Mickey's suggestion  to move the indication of the film closer to the description is right.  The Reluctant Fundamentalist is a short fast read and I think will work with one session.  ACCEPT25 Sep 2018 8:17 pm: Ron Ebert
The cd is short and would be enhanced by some of his “extended description”. For example the second paragraph in that extended material provides a much more clear explanation of the course goals that is lacking in the cd. I do wonder about fitting all of this into six weeks. Could he drop the film or one of the books?25 Sep 2018 8:29 pm: Katherine O'Connor
My comments relate to how the CD packages the course topic and not to the topic itself. I thought that the first three sentences of the second paragraph of his Extended Description would serve as an excellent introduction to his CD for the course catalogue. This echoes Mickey's concerns as well. His penultimate sentence on the ""three writing styles"" is vague and unclear. There are punctuation issues as well. 25 Sep 2018 11:30 pm: Penny Revelle
Except for the suggestion about moving the sentence about the film to after the sentence about writing style, I like the CD exactly as it is - clear, concise and interesting.  I think it has the flavor of Mike's personality and when a   CD achieves that I believe we shouldn't mess with it too much.26 Sep 2018 4:37 am: Susan Harris
I agree that the punctuation following the colon needs to be fixed and that the sentence about writing style should be moved.  I do like “With so many real terrorists around...” as an opening sentence but think it should be offered as a suggestion rather than a requirement.26 Sep 2018 9:11 am: Addison Stone
I like the basic idea for this SG, but I agree with comments suggesting that a lot is packed into too short a schedule. It might work, but Steve will have to be diligent in steering discussion efficiently if he is to accomplish his multi-faceted goals for analyzing these books and related issues. I wonder if he's be open to expanding the course into 8 or 10 weeks? One solution for the sentence beginning with ""We shall read..."" is to add some content to that short sentence, along the lines of ""We shall read three terrorist-oriented novels that deal vividly with the personalities and cultural settings in which terrorism takes root."" Then, the next three sentences would follow as written. Note the typo in the publisher of the third book.26 Sep 2018 11:04 am: Jim Whitters
I concur with Addison that this course, as set forth, should consider 10 class sessions. It certainly is an attractive course as described but is the reading simply too much to read and discuss in 6 weeks?26 Sep 2018 11:38 pm: Barbara Burr
I agree that the second paragraph of the extended information is better written than the CD.  Also wonder if 3 books and a film are too much for 6wks.  Overall a fine topic.27 Sep 2018 8:26 am: Fred Chanania
Sara:  I think it's a bit unclear if the film The Quiet American will be viewed in class or whether the SGMs are supposed to view it at home as homework.  This probably should be clarified in the CD.  If it is NOT going to be homework, then remove reference in the ""other required materials"" section.  If it IS going to be homework (which I doubt), then a bit more information will be needed to indicate how the SGMs are supposed to access the film.10 Oct 2018 4:26 pm: Fred Chanania

Sounds like a very thought-provoking course by a new member who is well qualified to be an excellent SGL. 
The fourth sentence, starting with We will immerse ourselves: an ""of"" was left out  between origins and Huck's.  I also recommend deleting (was Huck black?) in this sentence which is already very long.  
Also in this sentence: unrelenting use of the N-word and the limits of satire -- these seem like two unrelated observations that should be separated from each other by a comma.25 Sep 2018 11:54 am: Barbara Burr
Fine idea for a SG.  I completely agree with Mickey's edit suggestions.  It should be fascinating to read a variety of criticisms and analyses.25 Sep 2018 12:52 pm: Sara Freedman
Agree with both comments above. ""Unrelenting use (of is missing). Would like additional critiques representing the African American community. Right now I believe there is only one, Toni Morrison's. Might be some interesting articles about the issues that arise when the book has been taught in a variety of classrooms.25 Sep 2018 12:52 pm: Susan Harris
Great idea presented in an exciting way.  I agree with Mickey’s  adding of “of” and a comma.  I could go either way on “Was Huck black?”  The sentence is long but the question is intriguing.  Should the CD mention that the course is primarily discussion?25 Sep 2018 7:26 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with slight edits as suggested above.  I think leaving in  ""Was Huck black"" is interesting and add a twist.  Query are there other data, but maybe Toni Morrison has raised the issue sufficiently that others are not necessary.  I assume that Sara is suggesting that the issues raised by variety of classrooms might relate to gender, age, race of the classroom setting.  There may be scholarly work on these issues, but if not it might get difficult  to get meaningful discussion, rather than just speculation.  Agree this works as a course, and with edit ACCEPT 25 Sep 2018 8:42 pm: Katherine O'Connor
I applaud the topic and the focus of this course. The too long sentence that begins with ""We will immerse ourselves"" is syntactically very messy (faulty parallelism) and should be rewritten. The additional required and optional readings are varied and provocative. Sounds like a stimulating course.25 Sep 2018 11:18 pm: Penny Revelle
This looks like an interesting and timely course.
I would leave out ""(was Huck black)"", not that it's not an intriguing comment but because the sentence is already long and complicated.  It will still be an interesting discussion topic for one of the class sessions.  I'm OK with the rest of the sentence.  I don't think the parallelism is faulty but thank you Katherine for the term - I knew there must be a term for that grammatical error, but didn't know what it was.26 Sep 2018 8:54 am: Addison Stone
Sounds like an intriguing and thoughtful SG focus. I like the varied 'side' readings. Should make for lively, provocative discussions. I agree with the edits suggested above. Otherwise, I say Accept. One possible addition, probably to the optional readings, would be something representing the thinking of local schools/libraries that have taken the book off the curriculum and/or the shelves.26 Sep 2018 1:10 pm: Ron Ebert
Reviewing members comments demonstrates just how interesting this course will be. I would keed is huck black, but agree that the sentence should be shortened and rewritten. With above edits, accept26 Sep 2018 2:09 pm: David Bliss
For a 6-week course, there are many possible readings listed in ""other preparation"" .  Are these excerpts all to be posted on the class website? If they are required, it should be understood how they will be disseminated. It would be good to check with this new SGL to see if he is comfortable with using Canvas.27 Sep 2018 8:37 am: Fred Chanania

I think that this needs to be rewritten.  The topic may be interesting and timely, but presentation is a little confusing.  The third sentence (with five uses of democracy, democratic, etc) is unclear to me.  The Bill of Rights is anti-democratic? Or is it a guardrail?  Can he introduce the concept of guardrails before that?  
""The SG's goal is to understand what kinds of changes can be made to strengthen democracy.""  Perhaps change to ""should be made"" or ""need to be made"" or ""could be made"".  Perhaps move the goal of the course more to the beginning.
He should say something about the books.
Instead of ""topics include"" , ""we shall discuss...""  Do the texts cover those topics?

 24 Sep 2018 2:12 pm: Addison Stone
I agree with Linda that  this CD is confusing.  Needs a major rewrite. SGL needs to explain what is undemocratic about the Bill of Rights. I assume it has to do with constraining others? This tension between total freedom and reasoned constraints on behavior may be a key issue here, but it is not explicit. The sudden shift to ""topics"" in paragraph two is jarring. Does he mean ""instances"" within which the tensions alluded to in paragraph one will be explored? The last sentence should come earlier. Say something about how the two texts fit in. Also, is this discussion-based? On a minor note, I would hyphenate both ""mob dominated"" and ""upper class"" in sentence two. I assume that the opinion pieces mentioned under Other Prep are actually Other Required Materials?24 Sep 2018 4:36 pm: Ron Ebert
Yes, a rewrite is necessary- and remove many of those commas. Perhaps start with last sentence: ""The goal of this course is to understand what changes can be made to strengthen democracy, given that such forms of government are rare and often short lived.""24 Sep 2018 5:45 pm: Barbara Burr
I too was confused.  Perhaps some mention of the point of view and purpose of the the two chosen books in terms of the content of the SG...24 Sep 2018 6:05 pm: David Bliss
At 128 words, this CD has a lot of room for elaboration.  He could continue the metaphor of cliffs and guardrails by defining what those might be.  Some information about how the class will be run would also be useful.  The readings are very ambitious; the Klarman book is 840 pages, and the other required are also quite lengthy.  How much of the course will be about how the constitution was written versus discussion of how it is coming apart? Sounds like he should think about a syllabus to narrow it down a bit.24 Sep 2018 8:09 pm: Mickey Zemon
Cliffs and Guardrails -- this description must be in one of the books  or other materials he is using.  However, to introduce these words in the title and not elaborate on them in the CD is confusing.  Perhaps it would be better to just eliminate them from the title altogether.
I like the first two sentences but not the third one.  It sounds like he is saying that the Bill of Rights is both undemocratic and an undemocratic constitutional restraint.  This sentence needs a rewrite so it is clear what he is talking about.
Those topics could be rephrased as questions, for example: How does the internet impact our changing conceptions of free speech?  What are the implications of the marketplace's attitude toward regulation on democracy?  In what ways does the impact of the breakdown of trust on rule of law ...?
The two sentences starting with the SGL could be combined into one and moved to the end: The SG's goal is to discuss if some of the safeguards of democracy have become counterproductive and to understand what kinds of changes can be made to strengthen this form of government.  I think he should tighten this wording so that it expresses just what he intends to accomplish in this course.
In his bio, he needs to spell out Mass.
I think a very interesting course could  emerge from the second draft of this CD.
24 Sep 2018 10:15 pm: Jim Whitters
I know Joe as an excellent trial attorney and wordsmith. I concur with much of the commentary and recommend that this CD be rewritten. The course appears to have great potential but the amount of reading seems to be far too much. Klarman's superb book was the subject, by itself, of Sarah's course last Spring on the writing of the Constitution.25 Sep 2018 9:43 am: Helen Bakeman
I agree that he should drip Cliffs and Guardrails from the title....it would take a bunch of words in the CD to make clear what those words really mean within the context of this SG.  Move the last sentence to the beginning and broaden it—goal also seems to be to understand the weaknesses and contradictions built into our constitutional framework. Agree seems to be too much reading.  Third sentence is a jumble of too many “democratic” words...this is the sentence where he needs to clearly turn to the US and its constitution and sound less general (in the US, the Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution because.......; however, ......... and elebaorate from there.25 Sep 2018 9:56 am: Katherine O'Connor
I absolutely agree that the CD needs to be rewritten. The third sentence is the beginning of the problem. Is he saying that there is no such thing as a restraint that is not un- or anti- democratic? The reading seems overwhelmingly demanding.25 Sep 2018 1:07 pm: Sara Freedman
I agree that the CD is confusing and seems to be a fishing expedition about the inherent and lived problems with democracy, in the United States and the rest of the world. Doesn't seem to have a clear focus or thesis to focus the course. It is also not clear how the books will be used. The Klarman book is very long and dense, and it does not deal with the history of the Constitution after the inclusion of the Bill of Rights, yet the questions all deal with the history of democracy in the U.S. after its ratification. The second book seems to be a thoughtful discussion of the recent crises experienced by mostly Western democracies. I'm wondering if he wants to substitute the Klarman book with another book that focuses on problems of modern democracies but with perhaps a different slant than the one he has chosen. That would strengthen the focus and provide some good debate among current ways of thinking about democracy's strengths and weaknesses, and whether this form of government actually has a future in the coming generations.26 Sep 2018 5:04 am: Susan Harris
I agree that this needs to be rewritten for the reasons given above.  I think it would be possible to present the “ cliffs and guardrails” metaphor intelligibly if the SGL is wedded to it, but I agree it is not working as is.   From others’ comments the Klarman book seems like a poor choice: it’s too long given the other readings, its focus is on an earlier time period than the course’s focus, and it was recently covered in depth by another course.27 Sep 2018 8:20 am: Fred Chanania
Penny:  The other required materials section should be changed to match our usual practice.  Something like:  The SGL will post other required readings (book excerpts) on the course website.27 Sep 2018 12:06 pm: Penny Revelle
[Workflow note] I have posted the tentative syllabus which Re: Cliffs and Guardrails:  I have posted the tentative syllabus Joe sent me under ""additional information for the CC"".  I think this answers some of the criticisms about not knowing what he intends to present/discuss and would like CC members to read it.28 Sep 2018 7:57 am: Addison Stone
Penny, am I right that the CD remains unchanged? (Here's where access to the original CD would be helpful!) If so, does that mean that you and/or the Joe feel that it does not need any changes? Or is the inclusion of the syllabus info merely an intermediate step in the revision process?29 Sep 2018 4:26 pm: Sara Freedman
I am glad to see that the course has been extended to full term, but other than that I don't detect any real changes. It would be very helpful to see each week's readings as I am concerned that the readings as a whole are far too much for anyone to read and comment on thoughtfully. I'm also not clear how each reading responds to each question.  03 Oct 2018 2:06 pm: Mickey Zemon
I do not see any changes to the CD.  It is still two paragraphs and 134 words.  Not having the original to compare it to is a disadvantage. 03 Oct 2018 8:54 pm: David Bliss
Changes are not visible.07 Oct 2018 12:51 pm: Penny Revelle
[Workflow note] The CD and title have been rewritten to address committee comments.  In addition, I have tried to indicate that the whole of the Klaman book will not be required.  I added this under other required materials because I didn't know how else to show it.
Quest: do commas go inside parentheses?07 Oct 2018 1:04 pm: Sara Freedman
Thanks for the clarification about the changes made. Still concerned about the focus. The topic suggests it will discuss democracy as an institution in many different situations, but most of each week seems to be focused on the example of the U.S. Will the focus be on democracy writ large or specifically on the U.S.? 
Also, first week is exhaustive, could easily be divided into at least two weeks or more. Big leap from Week 2 to Week 3. Week 3 is also packed with major themes. Seems some support in figuring out the focus of each week would be helpful.07 Oct 2018 1:43 pm: Mickey Zemon
This revised CD is so much better. 
I  agree with the comments Sara makes above.
I do not think there should be a colon in the 4th sentence -- We will discuss: the changing conceptions of free speech
The SGs goal in the last sentence should be The SG's goal.
07 Oct 2018 4:15 pm: Addison Stone
The title and the CD work well together now. Indeed, my main concern relates to the syllabus and its relation to the CD. Seems like the SGL is trying to do way too much, ranging beyond what the CD seems to promise. The list of subtopics in week 1 is daunting; could be an entire SG of its own. I’m assuming that the SGL is planning to present some of this in the form of a lecture, rather than raising each question in succession for group discussion? In general, the mix of structured presentation versus discussion could be mentioned. Also, there seems to be another tension. The issues listed in the CD after “We will discuss” all seem to reflect quite current quandaries, but the syllabus reads more like a history of our democracy and its tensions. Which should be foregrounded—the history or the current issues?
I agree about dropping the colon in sentence 4. Also, in sentence 1 “short lived” should probably be hyphenated.
07 Oct 2018 4:26 pm: Ron Ebert
Much better now that it clarifies both cliffs and guardrails. I think the” we shall discuss: “ needs a bit of a rewrite. Perhaps break into two sentences and get rid of the  : . 08 Oct 2018 2:40 pm: Jim Whitters
I agree with Sara that the readings as a whole appear to be overwhelming for the class members to comment on thoughtfully. This is certainly a 12 week course but it still needs a more disciplined focus. 09 Oct 2018 10:18 am: David Bliss
Much better course description, but what part will be lecture and what part will be discussion?  The syllabus indicates the SGL will give presentations on a variety of historical subjects, and the CD talks about discussion of contemporary issues. Has he planned the ratio of lecture/discussion?10 Oct 2018 4:21 pm: Fred Chanania
[Workflow note] remove language in third sentence
last sentence needs to be shortened and changes, from last phrase;
give to TLC for work on syllabus12 Oct 2018 1:24 pm: Penny Revelle
[Workflow note] I have tried to address all the concerns brought up in Wednesday's meeting: "" focus is really on US,"" ""still not entirely clear why words cliffs and guardrails are used,' ""confusing use of the word undemocratic for the Bill of Rights"" and slightly too long a CD.  It's now 149 words and,  I hope, reads better.12 Oct 2018 2:58 pm: Linda Neumann
Nice work, Penny.  I think this clarifies the issues.  12 Oct 2018 3:45 pm: Helen Bakeman
I am not sure if we use the abbreviation SG but rather spell it out with new initial caps (in last sentence of course description). If I ignore the syllabus, which I believe we were instructed to do yesterday, this is fine.  (Otherwise, we have a syllabus that has 1/2 of the sessions focused on democratic and US constitutional history but a CD that focuses almost entirely on current issues (eg, effect of internet, breakdown of trust) andlooking forward).12 Oct 2018 5:11 pm: Sara Freedman
Much clearer, more delineated. Good work.12 Oct 2018 6:14 pm: Jim Whitters
much more clarity and discipline now---still seems to be a very ambitious undertaking. The SGL should comment on the books and how he intends to use them in the course.12 Oct 2018 8:48 pm: Barbara Burr
Does read better.  Doesn't capture the daunting scope of the syllabus, (but then we don't commonly see the syllabi of the courses...) Accept13 Oct 2018 8:30 am: Susan Harris
I would get rid of the colon but, otherwise, I think this CD is fine now.  Even the cliffs and guardrails are now comprehensible.  The syllabus does need work but I like Fred's suggestion to have TLC help with that.  13 Oct 2018 11:00 am: David Bliss
Very good revision.  I want to take this course!13 Oct 2018 11:51 am: Fred Chanania
Penny, looks good to me.  Two re-writes if you can:
Third sentence has a number of misplaced modifiers and awkward syntax.  Would you be willing to just massage it a bit to read:  With a primary focus on the US, we will discuss the changing conceptions of free speech (especially the internet’s impact), the implications in democracy from the marketplace's attitude toward regulation, the result of the breakdown of trust on the rule of law, and whether some of the safeguards originally included in our Constitution have become counterproductive. 
Last sentence: ""such forms"" should be changed to ""this form"" since we are only talking about the one form - democracy.13 Oct 2018 3:50 pm: Sara Freedman
Good work in helping with the rewrite. Thanks.13 Oct 2018 3:55 pm: Addison Stone
Nice changes. Agree with Fred re need to tinker with third sentence. Also, agree that someone in TLC should talk with SGL about seeming mismatch between CD and syllabus. I suspect that it's a matter of adjusting superordinates and subordinate topic in the outline, but who knows. At an editorial level, I still think that ""short lived"" (sentence 1), ""mob dominated"" (sentence 2), and ""upper class"" (sentence 2) should be hyphenated. Also, consider adding a comma after ""democracies"" in sentence 2.13 Oct 2018 4:08 pm: Penny Revelle
[Workflow note] I have deleted a comma in sentence 2, adde a hyphen to mob-dominated, written out Study Group instead of SG and accepted most of Fred's rewrite of sentence 3.

Interesting topic, perhaps complements the other SG proposal on the Enlightenment... Regarding the first sentence: I think not everyone might know that it is actually a book she is using.  Also, the structure and punctuation are odd.  The SGL presumes to know “many of us” have little reason for optimism.  This is certainly an unnuanced and sweeping assumption....depends what you are talking about etc. But I think this is basically a provacative and interesting topic for a SG.21 Sep 2018 2:12 pm: David Bliss
A good topic with a strong study group leader. I get it that she is not just just a cheerleader for the neo-liberal view.  But rather than saying ""many of us are not optimistic"" perhaps better to say ""a world that for many, has failed to fulfill the promise of those values.""22 Sep 2018 7:49 am: Susan Harris
Replace the second colon of the first sentence with ""including"" or get rid of it some other way.  Otherwise I'm fine with the writing and would accept as is.22 Sep 2018 8:38 am: Ron Ebert
First sentence structure is awkward ( length of life, health, wealth...). Perhaps put length of life at end of list, or use modifiers for each of the items. Otherwise well written and very interesting. Accept.22 Sep 2018 9:45 am: Linda Neumann
Interesting topic with a book that has engendered a lot of discussion and controversy.  The bio is very short - perhaps she should include the remark in her comment that this course overlaps or repeats some of the material in her previous course.  As everyone noted, need to clean up the first sentence with the double colons.  Accept22 Sep 2018 1:19 pm: Jim Whitters
very attractive course with much substance to encourage robust debate led by a SGL who possesses considerable experience in dealing with real world issues-----agreeing with above recommendations-----Accept.23 Sep 2018 8:53 am: Sara Freedman
This should be a provocative study group, appealing to a wide swath of members. I have no objection to the ""many of us are not optimistic"" since that rings true to me, at the very least, and is the basis of the study group itself. That is, that many look to the future with trepidation. Pinker posits a quite different view, so it is good to explore his ideas systematically and thoroughly. I am confident Mary Jo will do just that.23 Sep 2018 9:28 am: Helen Bakeman
Excellent SGL with an important topic and book.  Agree with Sara that there  really is no problem with “many of us are not optimistic”....it is true (she is not saying MOST of us). Colons in first sentence—agree with Linda’s comment and wonder if there should be a capital “Since’ after the first colon. Otherwise, leave it as it is...it is her voice23 Sep 2018 9:22 pm: Penny Revelle
Well, I would go with ""some of us,""  just to show that she is willing to accept other people's point of view and also so readers don't get the feeling that she is going to disagree strongly with the author of the book she has chosen.
I agree that the sentence about her previous course would be useful in the biography.
I've read several of Pinker's books and wonder if 2 hours will be enough prep time for everybody.
Sounds like an interesting course, though - lots to discuss.23 Sep 2018 9:25 pm: Penny Revelle
addendum:  that would be about 60 pages/week24 Sep 2018 9:12 am: Addison Stone
I agree that this will be an excellent SG. A definite Accept. I was a participant in last year's version, and I thought Mary Jo did an excellent job. She does presume some facility with data/graph interpretation, which proved a challenge for a small number of folks last year, but she flags that issue here. Also, doubt that Pinker's book has anywhere near as many detailed graphs as Angus Deaton's book had. I like David's suggested rewrite of the ""optimism"" sentence. Also, I found the sentence beginning with ""Study group meetings will consist..."" to be a bit awkward. How about, ""Study group meetings will consist largely of structured discussions of the Pinker book as some supplementary readings provided by the SGL."" Also, note that this sentence seems to suggest that the supplementary readings are an integral part of the SG, but her statement under Other Prep says that only the book is required. Inconsistent. Finally, like Penny, I wonder if 2 hours is the right estimate for workload, especially if the supplemental readings really are required. Yes, she should mention the connection to last year's SG in her bio (if that's the right place).25 Sep 2018 9:49 am: Katherine O'Connor
Sorry I'm coming to this so late. The SGL already has experience with this topic in a previous course - which is a good thing --but I wondered about the repetition issue if she hopes to appeal to some of those who were in her other course. I applaud a critical discussion of the Pinker book!27 Sep 2018 8:17 am: Fred Chanania
Mickey:  In the ""other preparation"" section, there is this sentence:  I will provide some supplementary materials to challenge and/or complement Pinker's arguments.  Required reading will be only the book.
We have a general type of boilerplate for this to avoid repetition and inconsistency.  Something like:  The SGL will post other required materials on the course website.  
The boilerplate (sort of) could also read:  The SGL will post other required materials analyzing Pinker's arguments on the course website.
We would probably ask for this change at the vote or the co-chairs would do it during their final review.  Let's do it now if possible.  Thanks03 Oct 2018 7:26 pm: Mickey Zemon

I love the title and the tone of the CD -- but the italics have got to go.  It seems like a heavy load of reading but she does say excerpts from these novels.  She will have to copy those excerpts and distribute copies to the class. These excerpts should not be too long because these novels are under copyright.
Judy is very well qualified and will make an excellent SGL.  
19 Sep 2018 6:02 pm: Mickey Zemon
Ugh, forgot to mention two typos in first sentence:  a a memoir and words(less).19 Sep 2018 6:06 pm: David Bliss
To write a memoir each week for twelve weeks seems a bit challenging.  Is that how Suzanne Pemsler ran the course? I think she should think about the format of the class, and maybe tighten up the part about the book selections. 19 Sep 2018 8:23 pm: Ron Ebert
Suzanne didn't require a memoir every week- i think judy should ease that requirement too. Perhaps ask members to select one excerpt at a time from one of the books.  Not enough time to cover that material as well as the memoirs. Judy is just the right person to lead this class. Accept. 19 Sep 2018 9:40 pm: Jim Whitters
Appears to be an excellent course but I am wondering whether there is too much writing over a 12 week period. Otherwise, accept.19 Sep 2018 10:12 pm: Helen Bakeman
I don’t know what the etiquette is but.,..my understanding was that Jean Speizer was going to pick up the mantle for memoi writing (she is leading the course this term).  Should someone check in with her? We do need clarification about the reading (does everyone have to buy all of the books? Or do you get and read what you would like?) and about whether writing will really be required each week.  20 Sep 2018 9:19 am: Susan Harris
In addition to this being a lot of writing, it doesn't seem realistic to me to discuss 12 memoirs in each class (class size max is 12).  That would give only 10 mins per proposal even if there were no breaks or time spent on housekeeping issues.  I don't see anything inherently wrong with two people doing memoir classes if the demand is there.  Is it?  20 Sep 2018 9:54 am: Dick Rubinstein
I agree that the primary issue here is the structure of the course, in terms of preparation and how much can be done in each class. Yes, and kill the italics. Not ready for a vote.

A more general issue: Books that are not to be purchased (e.g. excerpts to be supplied, or available in the HILR library) should probably not be listed in the catalog at all, lest people think they have to go out and buy them. Reference to specific materials to be handed out are fine in the CD, but don’t need to be exhaustive.20 Sep 2018 11:31 am: Addison Stone
I agree that this proposal needs more thought. I don't see how SGM's could realistically write their own memoir AND read thoughtfully those of 11 other people in the time frame mentioned. Also, the role of the books needs clarification. Certainly, they should not all be required if the writing/critiquing assignment is not altered. I think we should send this one back to the SGL with a list of issues to consider. It is also important to consider how many other memoir-writing SG's may be in the works.20 Sep 2018 1:06 pm: Frank Speizer
I can clarify one issue.  Jeanne Speizer (was actually hoping Judy would step forward) is not back in town early enough to be able to offer this course in the Spring semester.  23 Sep 2018 8:57 am: Sara Freedman
Agree with above comments, in that course needs more thought - too many books, too much writing required, not clear how all of what she outlines can be realistically done in one course period. I like her spirit, which should be retained in the rewrite.23 Sep 2018 9:11 pm: Penny Revelle
So, have we changed the most commonly used prep time required from 3 hours per week to 4?  Is this a recognition of how much time it actually takes to prepare for a course or just random drift?  Maybe  we should discuss this and give proposal submitters guidance?
Also there does seem to be a disconnect between how much the sgl would like people to write and how much time there is to discuss it.  Maybe only part of the class, in rotation, could write and submit a memoir and then there would be time to discuss the submissions.
The four books together come to $36 on Amazon so that's within our guidelines, but the total page count comes to 1248 pages which seems a lot for a writing course.  If she only means the sgls to read parts of the books, that needs to be more clearly explained.  From the way it is stated now I couldn't tell if she meant they would read parts of the books in class or just what parts they wanted to at home.  Also, no need to retell the books in the CD when they are listed in the book section.24 Sep 2018 6:41 pm: Linda Neumann
[Workflow note] Several changes:  
1)  The method of submitting copies of memoirs for discussion in the next session is the format that Suzanne used and it worked well
2)  Judy has removed all the four  books as required reading.  Nothing required, but some optional reading may be posted.
3) The CD is quite short and I suggested adding  some more enticements, but she didn't see the need.

She loved Suzanne's course and uses it as a model.

Suggestions?24 Sep 2018 6:43 pm: Linda Neumann
[Workflow note] When I was in edit mode, I could delete the books from the table, but not the text that appeared below.

There are no books required.25 Sep 2018 9:37 am: Katherine O'Connor
I agree with the concerns abut the workload. The length of the required weekly memoir also sounded extreme. Couldn't there be some guidance about the different kinds of things memoir writing can focus on?  Is the weekly memoir writing assignment always completely open?25 Sep 2018 7:54 pm: Frank Speizer
I think there may be some confusion in the CD that needs clarification.  I don't think a weekly submission is required.  In fact from my knowledge from Jeanne's past experience is that Susan (and Jeanne) never anticipated that all members of the class would submit each week.  In addition by indicating ""up to 2000 word"" which probably sounds like a little for Judy, sounds like a lot to most of us non-regular writers, and simply to indicate something like short vignettes, or memoir pieces, without a word count would probably be more attractive.  The issue of 4 hours is an interesting one, in that the general feedback in the course is that everyone seems to become committed to doing the time/week required to review all of the weeks submissions.  With modest re-write ACCEPT  27 Sep 2018 8:35 am: Fred Chanania
Linda:  Since there are no other required materials, there should be a blank space in the Other Required Materials section.  Please remove the text that is there.  Thanks.03 Oct 2018 8:51 pm: David Bliss
I still have trouble with each member writing each week a 2000 word memoir.  I couldn't do it myself.  Maybe I could write a short vignette, but I don't have enough energy to write a memoir each week.  Just me.  Will there be time enough in class to read them and discuss each one individually?  04 Oct 2018 6:00 pm: Judy Elstein
I’m concerned that there is no book nor a clear indication of what readings might be presented on the website.  In the first draft Mary Karr, Stephen King, and Alexandra Fuller were mentioned as models of memoirist.  All three have written excellent and quite different memoirs.  The SGL can use samples from each or choose one, but those sources should be indicated in the CD. Agree that class participants should not make the choice of reading as was indicated in first draft, but SGL certainly can.    
 
09 Oct 2018 8:32 pm: Frank Speizer
There is such a history for this course, I think that those who sign up know what they are getting into.  Clearly, the members seem to self regulate how often they submit a vignette. I think you just need Judy to modify the 2000 words that seems to be stymieing us all12 Oct 2018 11:51 pm: Linda Neumann
[Workflow note] After I discussed with several members familiar with memoir courses, we have taken out the requirement to submit a memoir of up to 2000 words per week. (Judy is a professional writer and that seemed natural to her.)  Judy will work out the frequency of memoirs with the SGMs in class.  We have added references to additional memoirs for reading.  No books required.

Note:  after I deleted the books from the required list, I was not able to delete the books from the ""Readings Catalog Text"" field.  I changed prep time to 3 hours, but could not change it in the ""Course Info Catalog Text"" field.  Does this matter?13 Oct 2018 6:23 am: Barbara Burr
I think it sounds much better. A flexible approach to the writing assignments in terms os frequency, length etc seems most codusive to participants’ variable needs. Choice of memoir examples is excellent. Gentle editing is a good way of putting it.13 Oct 2018 8:44 am: Addison Stone
Does seem more realistic in terms of reading/writing. However, I'm not clear re the role of the sample memoirs. No books are now required, but will the memoir excerpts be required? If not, why highlight them in the CD? Will SGL 
 provide any upfront orientation re approaches to writing memoirs and/or give suggestions for topic/lifestage/angle to address in choosing what to write about, or will SGMs be left totally on their own to write whatever? The latter seems a be too free-form, at least for me, and to insure a bit of chaos in the group discussions. 13 Oct 2018 9:18 am: Susan Harris
I find the tone of the CD a little light but can live with it.  I would not be in favor of adding a lot of reading or imposing too much structure on the course.   I know, from having lead two prior writing courses here, that the SGL needs flexibility to ensure that everyone has a chance to discuss his/her work in some depth.  The length of written pieces and the frequency of presentation need to be managed by the SGL in real time to make that happen.  I expect that many SGMs will have work in progress that they will continue working on in the SG -- thus specific assignments may be useful for some (memoir newbies) but not helpful for others.  Certain to be popular.13 Oct 2018 9:22 am: Mickey Zemon
Last sentence: Does she mean she will post excerpts from these memoirs or the entire memoir on the course website? Are these memoirs going to be discussed in class?  These memoirs are published works so she is not going to be able to link to them on the internet.  Is she going to scan them?  How much is she going to scan from the original? 
13 Oct 2018 11:31 am: Penny Revelle
It looks to me as if adding the words ""excerpts from""  to the sentence ""The SGL will post selected memoirs by Mary Karr, Stephen King, and Alexandra Fuller on the website for additional reading.""  Would solve lot of the committee's concerns.  
Otherwise I think the fluid nature of the description of how the course is structured is right for this course - it will take its final structure from the SGMs who sign up.13 Oct 2018 12:01 pm: Helen Bakeman
I think that Penny’s suggestion of “exerpts from” takes care of the posted memoir issue.  Accept13 Oct 2018 1:32 pm: Linda Neumann

With this in mind, we will explore the origins of journalism and newspapers in America. As the 18th century began and ended, legal restrictions were imposed on the press. Throughout this period, fights for press freedoms were front and center. Printers, publishers, writers, and editors faced threats of seditious libel and played a major role in convincing the people to seek independence, ratify the constitution, and establish a culture of acceptance of dissent.

Seems like a relevant and interesting historical topic.  Since the SG is based solely on events of the 18th century, and since the syllabus he suggests does not include any current discussions of the role of the press, I do wonder if the SGL plans to go back to the questions he raises in the first two sentences of the CD?19 Sep 2018 5:06 pm: Mickey Zemon
I agree with Barbara.  He mentions the implications for our country today in the second sentence and third sentence and again in the last sentence -- but he needs to spell out that connection more clearly in the course description.  Maybe he could move sentence two and three to the end of the proposal and clarify the connection there.
The sentence starting with Throughout this period is very long and could easily be divided into two sentences.  In that sentence there should be a comma between writers and editors -- i.e., writers, and editors.
Sounds like a good course.

19 Sep 2018 8:16 pm: Ron Ebert
I like Mickey’s idea of moving the first two sentences to the end and linking to the course. Remove “the” before freedom of the press in first sentence. Good idea for a course.19 Sep 2018 9:35 pm: Jim Whitters
The focus of the course appears to be on the press in the American colonies in the 18th century----I would keep the focus on the 18th century and illustrate the important litigation that occurred then that ultimately had an important impact later on upon American libel law. This should be an interesting course.19 Sep 2018 9:46 pm: Linda Neumann
Agree with Barbara.  The syllabus and most of the CD describe a course in the history of the  press in 18th century.  I admit that I do see what the implications are for our present situation, especially considering the different environment with the technology and tools of modern communication.  Perhaps he could add something specific on lessons learned or not learned.  Or devote part of the syllabus to show similarities to our present situation.20 Sep 2018 9:30 am: Susan Harris
I agree with the above.  The first two sentences make one expect a course about contemporary issues but the description as a whole describes something different.  Either focus on the 18th century as Jim suggests OR better integrate 18th century events with current events as others have suggested.  I think the SGL should have that choice.20 Sep 2018 10:01 am: David Bliss
The first sentence of the CD is a good one to attract interest, but it seems clear that the course is really about the history of press freedom.  Maybe the CD should make it more clear that this is not a current events course.20 Sep 2018 11:24 am: Addison Stone
I agree that there is a seeming tension between the exclusive focus on 18th century issues signaled by the topic list and readings versus the hints regarding implications for today. If the opening is merely an attention-grabber, then that should be signaled somehow. If, however, the SGL is serious about making that connection, he might consider some adjustment to the topic list and/0r readings? Alternatively, he might consider the value of a running study question that focuses SGM's and at least some discussion on implications flowing from each weekly focus for today's issues.20 Sep 2018 1:18 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree this is an interesting topic as a historical look at freedom of the press.  There just may be too much material to really be able to get into contemporary ideas for each session as well.  Agree that moving sentences on the ideas of comparing current time would be better toward the end of the CD.  That is in fact what the Sessions outline says is going to happen.  In sentence 5, I think the ""are"" should be ""were"".  23 Sep 2018 9:07 am: Sara Freedman
I agree that starting with today's issues misleads the reader, as it seems to suggest that considerable time will be spent on a comparison between the issues facing the press during the 18th century and today. Would start with announcing that the course will focus on the 18th century, noting that the issues of publication and suppression laid the groundwork, and/or are similar to, those facing the press throughout the country's history. (Or is he saying that the 18th century was different from subsequent ones?) Could start with sentence with ""In this course..."" while extending the sentence to make clear the course will cover the struggles over publication and suppression. Love the idea of using primary source material, something this SGL has used in his other courses. 23 Sep 2018 8:47 pm: Penny Revelle
I think that the second sentence should be removed because it implies that the course will deal substantially with present day press issues while the further information section makes clear that this is not so.
Also, in the current 5th sentence, don't you have to say ""As the 18th century began and ended, legal restrictions were ....."" ? Judy?
Finally, I would like to see a more aggressive first sentence to capture readers' interest.  Something like: It may be a shock to hear the members of the press called ""enemies of the people"" but has the American press always  described a group of individuals known for their honesty and upright values?  and then go on with ""In this course we will.....""

Agree that the CD is now more nicely focused on what the SG actually seems to be. Two possible edits: I would split the fourth sentence into two sentences, ending the first at “front and center,” deleting “as,” and beginning the next sentence with “Printers….” Also, ""review chronologically"" reads better than ""chronologically review"" to my ear.02 Oct 2018 10:31 am: Helen Bakeman
Much improved.  However, the second sentence indicates that we will explore origins of journalism/newspapers in America...wouldn’t it be more accurate to add something like “and attacks on press freedom.” I think that the SG is about both those things, yes?03 Oct 2018 8:42 pm: David Bliss
Very good revision.  I agree with helen that the second sentence should be about the origins of attacks on journalism.  To review the origin of the  entire cannon of journalism is too much for a 6-week course04 Oct 2018 5:50 pm: Katherine O'Connor

Jim is fully qualified to lead this seminar, which is squarely in his professional field. Being a potentially emotional topic, I think it’s hard to predict how popular it will be, but I think 18 is probably a sensible limit, given that discussion is central. The CD is concise and says what it needs to say. My only question is the four hours of preparation. That’s worth discussing this with him. Accept.19 Sep 2018 10:01 am: Katherine O'Connor
I agree that 4 hours of preparation stated so unequivocally should be reconsidered. Jim is obviously the ideal person to give this course. I may be wrong, but I think it will appeal to many people precisely because of its focus on the intense legal, religious, and philosophical debates surrounding the issue of “taking one’s death in hand,” as it were, rather than on the physical and psychological agonies of the dying process itself.

Counting in at 107 words, this course description feels like it could use some enhancing.  How about a taste of some of the philosophical and religious arguments for and against PAS and/or a brief mention of some of the important state and supreme court decisions about the practice?
The first sentence suggests that PAS was not a divisive issue before the 1980s, but could this be so?
It would be so good to have a text for this course.  
The prospective SGL is so well qualified and the course so relevant that these concerns seem like small potatoes.

I would put a hyphen between physician and assisted, but since he is knowledgeable in the field, he probably knows better.  It might be worthwhile to add a sentence about the fallout from states that have legalized PAS.20 Sep 2018 11:12 am: Addison Stone
Jim is a thoughtful, even-keeled fellow who is well qualified both substantively and experientially to lead engaging, balanced discussions of this provocative topic. Definitely accept.  I agree that some central 'text' would be helpful, if such a beast exists. Perhaps it could take the form of a few review chapters from books dealing with a broader range of issues in medical ethics. Seems to me that 'physician-assisted' should be hyphenated, even if it doesn't always appear that way in the literature.20 Sep 2018 1:46 pm: Frank Speizer
Excellent topic.  I think the 3rd sentence need to have ""...as well as legal issues ..."" added to it.  I too agree there must be a text out there that could be used as general background and that 4 hours a week seems heavy.  ACCEPT with expanded CD.  23 Sep 2018 9:10 am: Sara Freedman
Provocative and certainly timely subject, for us, led by a highly qualified SGL. Four hours is out of the norm, and needs to be discussed with the SGL. Would have liked a sample of the readings he will be offering.23 Sep 2018 8:29 pm: Penny Revelle
I think this sentence from the Other Preparation section: ""And, as an example of how a major medical group is seeking to find a way to respect the conflicting viewpoints, I will draw on my own experience with the ongoing policy review process at the American Medical Association."" could go into the CD.  It seems to me to emphasize how interesting it will be to discuss this subject with a leader who has ""skin in the game.""
I also think that 4 hours prep might be off putting to potential sgms and it hasn't been justified in this case.
If there is a ""huge literature"" on the ethics of PAS surely there is a text that could be assigned. Or if the sgl doesn't like any one in particular, then perhaps parts of more than one text?

Jim:  We generally have a sort-of boilerplate for the other required materials section.  What is there isn't bad, but we probably should change it to:  The study group leader will provide excerpts from or links to other materials on the course website.02 Oct 2018 3:00 pm: Sara Freedman
Talked with Jim during the black bag. He may cut the number of participants to 12 as the topic requires a degree of intimacy among participants and 18 may be too large. Agree that he is the perfect SGL for this topic, which is certainly germaine to our members. 04 Oct 2018 6:54 am: Addison Stone
The expanded CD is a nice improvement. I’m okay with the decision to drop the cap to 12, given the topic. Jim can always offer the SG again. Apparently, Jim has decided not to use a text (still no Required Books section in the revision). Okay, but then the statement in Other Required Materials shouldn’t have the word “other” in it. Also, couldn’t that statement pick up some of the wording in the Other Preparation section (e.g., “readings exemplifying the strongest arguments…”), adding something about the types of readings (journal essays? Essays in the popular press? Position papers from major organizations? Court decisions?)

Note that “physician-assisted” is still not hyphenated in the title, or in one occurrence in the CD. Delete extraneous space in one occurrence of “physician-assisted.”04 Oct 2018 9:43 am: Helen Bakeman

We will examine forces that shape the local marine world and look closely at rocky shores, sandy beaches, awesome seaweeds, delightful invertebrates like lobsters, and important fish species like cod. This study group will also consider what we can and cannot predict about the future of our oceans and, in particular, the Gulf of Maine, which is warming faster than any other marine system.

Since I have taken one of his courses, I am a believer! The CD is very appealing to a general audience.  No need to describe the readings as ""easy"".  Let the books speak for themselves.20 Sep 2018 10:59 am: Addison Stone
Took this SG 3 years ago and enjoyed it, as did others. Definitely an 'accept.' The above editorial suggestions are reasonable, but my own recommendation would be to delete sentences 2-5 completely. Then, use the available words to say something about the marine biology theme represented by the first book but seemingly missing from the CD.20 Sep 2018 12:45 pm: Frank Speizer
Coming in late and have not taken one of these courses (scheduling problems); but would have to agree with Addison that the CD seems a ""little too casual"".  I don't think Fred needs to worry about selling this as it comes with a great reputation.  I think some more marine biology and direction and depth is required.  Eg, is it the biology of the organisms, food chain, environmental interactions, (all of the above) that the course will cover? These are mentioned, but now it seems to read somewhat as let's just enjoy a day (6 days) on the sea.  23 Sep 2018 9:13 am: Sara Freedman

This is a fabulous and very current science topic, and will be an excellent course. I’ve been in SGs lead by both Dan and Murray, and they’re both solid in their knowledge and preparation. Dan has taught evolution previously, and is a patient explainer of science. Murray, historically less patient, more but equally serious about teaching. The CD is 172 words, and needs to be cut back. I’m sure Dan, as the lead SGL, will be amenable to this, as he knows the rules from his time on the CC. The special room request is nonsense, and must be politely turned down. Tess will usually try to honor coordination requests from spouses and people with long commutes, but this definitely pushes the boundary. With these issues addressed, accept.19 Sep 2018 9:09 am: Jim Whitters
Impressive course proposal-----with Dick's recommended changes, accept.19 Sep 2018 10:20 am: Katherine O'Connor
I agree that the special requests are ludicrously presumptuous, that is, absurd. Shouldn’t the third line have a colon instead of a dash after origins?  Do 4 hours prep sound more defensible and less off-putting here because the course is so obviously a demanding one. Should something be said to warn/discourage the “genomically ignorant”?
Accept.
19 Sep 2018 11:59 am: Helen Bakeman
Very impressive and timely course proposal.  One place to get rid of words is delete the list of places in the second sentence and replace with “all over the world”....but at least get rid of the “even” before “Africa.”  I do think that the CD contains sufficient language that makes it clear that this will be accessible to the layperson.  Hurrah for the brief bios.19 Sep 2018 3:55 pm: Barbara Burr
A good topic - I agree with the above comments, esp the language of the scheduling request.  I do wonder whether the SG is mostly descriptive or whether there are other sorts of insights to be gleaned from learning about about migration, population mixing,  etc...19 Sep 2018 4:13 pm: Mickey Zemon
I agree with all of the above comments for trimming down the description and declining the special request. Also agree that this is an important and interesting course led by two excellent study group leaders.19 Sep 2018 8:03 pm: Ron Ebert
Yes to shortening the cd by removing all that geography. Will the requirement that all members do a presentation limit applicants? As for the special room request - ha ha19 Sep 2018 10:05 pm: Linda Neumann
Dan and Murray are excellent SGLs, very thorough and precise in their preparations and presentations.  This will be a challenging and exciting course.  The book is excellent.  They do not require member presentations, only that the members do some research in a topic that will be discussed.  Idea is that they will participate more actively in that discussion.  4 hours prep is realistic for their courses.  Accept, after some editing to shorten the CD.  Special requests - perplexing20 Sep 2018 10:41 am: David Bliss
Excellent topic for a study group.  The long CD could be shortened by dropping the phrases in parentheses.20 Sep 2018 10:49 am: Addison Stone
Agree with all of the above comments. I've taken SG's with both, and although they assign challenging material and set a high bar for discussion, they both do a good job of making sure that SGM's are 'with them' (having already discouraged some potentially inadequately prepared SGM's by means of the CD!). Murray used the SGM special-preparation approach in a study group last year and it worked well. No presentation, but he did expect the relevant SGM to chime in substantively and often during the relevant week. Accept with minor edits, ignoring the scheduling request.22 Sep 2018 8:02 am: Susan Harris
I took an evolution class with Murray as SGL and Dan as an especially helpful SGM.  It was challenging even for those of us with science background, but I found it well worth the work - one of the best courses I've taken here.  This proposed course has a similar format and I would expect it to work equally well.  The 4 hr prep time does seem excessive.   Accept after minor editing as described above and possible reduction of the workload.  And yes, haha to the room request.23 Sep 2018 9:20 am: Sara Freedman
Agree with all of the above comments - the course topic is important and will draw many members, the format is well designed and has the potential to increase the participation of members in class discussions. Four hours is a lot but given the topic and the reading, may be realistic, as many members may have to read the selections at least more than once. Ignore the scheduling request - it is bizarre to say the least. What if everyone followed their lead?23 Sep 2018 8:04 pm: Penny Revelle
I think the CD is well written and explains exactly what sgms will be getting into if they sign up.  That said, the second sentence could probably be deleted without losing any important information.  I would also leave in the 4 hours of prep time - best to be up front about it if the course will require a lot of time.
I'd love to be able to make a scheduling request like that but so would we all.  I can't see how Tess would be able to honor it.23 Sep 2018 8:13 pm: Penny Revelle
addendum:  I would like to see a few words in the bio's about the sgls' background, if applicable, or why this topic interests them if their backgrounds are not.24 Sep 2018 9:26 am: Frank Speizer

We encounter light in its many forms when we open our eyes, use our cell phones, listen to radio, and receive X-rays. Light is simply a form of energy making up the electromagnetic spectrum, and our human eye can see only a tiny sliver of that spectrum. Yet radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays are all part of the same phenomenon. This study group, intended for nonscientists, will tour the spectrum: the various types of light, how they were discovered, and the scientific and everyday applications. We will learn how scientists get spectacular images of distant galaxies, how some animals and cameras see in the dark, why the sky is blue, and how light helps us monitor the earth and atmosphere.

This class will have great appeal to non-scientists, like myself,  as well as many scientists from other fields.
I don't think Study Group should have an upper case S and G and that Various after the colon in the fifth sentence should have an upper case V.  Electromagnetic is one word -- is there a reason for it and Spectrum to start with upper case letters?
Not sure about starting the last sentences with As a bonus -- the whole course sounds like a bonus to me.
The last sentence is not a complete sentence.
There is a typo in the title.
18 Sep 2018 8:24 pm: Mickey Zemon

Great idea!  Agree with the above edits regarding caps etc.  Might leave out ""such"" in front of spectacular...In the bio, might say ""which involved"" instead of ""involving.""18 Sep 2018 8:47 pm: Penny Revelle
Because this is a course about light as well as other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum I believe is an ideal place to use videos in class to engage sgms as well as to stimulate discussion. A course composed entirely of lectures, as is suggested by the last sentence, would be less appealing to potential sgms.  If that's not what she means, ie if she does intend to have a variety of materials in her presentations, I think she should say what they might be.19 Sep 2018 6:58 am: Dick Rubinstein
This can be a good course. We have plenty of non-scientists who are curious and will jump in. I agree with Penny that the course need not be straight lecture. In addition to videos, I think the topic begs for demonstrations and experiments. What fun! Accept, with the above preening of the CD, and also in bio “hopes to stimulate a curiosity  science” rather than .19 Sep 2018 8:50 am: Addison Stone
Sounds like a good way to engage non-scientists in some interesting phenomena. I agree with others that the final sentence (""primarily SGL presentations"") may be off-putting. It's clear from the Other Materials and Other Preparation that many videos and 'images' will be included in those presentations, so it isn't just lecture. However, that could be clearer in the actual CD. In the CD, I came to a halt at the phrase ""will tour the spectrum."" I assume that that is an intentional pun, but somehow it misfires for me. I'd phrase it more prosaically. Agree with other suggested edits.19 Sep 2018 10:33 am: Katherine O'Connor
This sounds like it will be a science course that is truly targeted to the non-scientists. I agree with  Mickey’s comments. I do think that many of those who are interested in this topic will tolerate a fairly large input by the SGL. The sentence that stars with”This” at the end of line 6 needs to be reworked following the colon after “spectrum.” Accept.19 Sep 2018 7:57 pm: Ron Ebert
Yes, prune as above. Should be an interesting course19 Sep 2018 9:45 pm: Jim Whitters
Accept with above mentioned changes----interesting, and different, course.20 Sep 2018 10:35 am: Susan Harris
Great idea.  Agree with the minor edits, especially removing some caps and adding ""and.""  Personally, I think there should be a place in the catalog for some courses, like this one, that are mainly presentations from the SGL.  Such courses are best when the SGM is very well versed in the topic area - and Linda is.20 Sep 2018 1:00 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with much of above, but would be cautious about suggesting too much.  Linda seems to be offering an introductory course to non-scientist of a topic that should be of interest to a significant pool and by stating it as a lecture course with time for questions will be attractive.  On the other hand, if she gets int more ""hands on demonstrations"" rather than videos the appeal might change significantly.  I think what she has proposed will work, and leave it up to her to decide how much further she would want to take it.  ACCEPT23 Sep 2018 9:26 am: Sara Freedman
The topic is fascinating and I appreciate her appeal to and sensitivity toward non-scientists. That said, I think the course would greatly benefit from some kind of ""hands-on"" experiences as well as discussions that help members explore the extent to which they understand the lectures and videos. It is my experience that without these additions, we tend to think we ""get"" the material but often don't. 24 Sep 2018 11:10 am: David Bliss

Instead, be prepared to discover the range and depth of Dylan’s literary and cultural impact through the poetic power of his songs. For more than 50 years, Dylan has addressed the issue of social justice, war and the human response to war, love and death, faith and religion, songs as compensation for the realities of mortality, the very stuff of poetry.

Agree with Ron that this is a winner!
Sentence starting with Instead be prepared: I think ""as he addresses"" should be ""as he addressed""
Same sentence: add an ""and"" between religion, songs -- ""religion, and songs""
Same sentence: It would help if ""as Harvard Professor Richard Thomas says in his book Why Bob Dylan Matters, the text for this class"" was placed in parenthesis at the end of the sentence since it is a very long sentence as it now stands.
I do not know how many lyrics Kate is planning to copy for the course but there may be copyright issues here.  My advice is to let Gnomen Copy service on Mass Ave do it since they handle  Fair Use issues all the time.  They get the copyright clearance and they charge the students for the packet.  However, if the lyrics are available on Google, they are already in the public domain and she could just post them on her course website.  
She says in her proposal that the book by Thomas is the text for the course but under Other Req. Materials she says it is optional.  I think it is important to have a text for the class and to use it as basis for discussions.
Regarding her special request under Further Information: that is breaking a long-standing precedent that perhaps should be broken but to do so is going to take some doing.14 Sep 2018 11:45 pm: Linda Neumann
Probably will be very popular.  The idea of having double sessions is interesting,  but  don't see it happening.  It could be offered again in the fall (as Gene Ferrari's HIstory of the Earth was this year.)

Agree with Ron and Mickey that the text book issue should be clear.  If she calls it the text of the class, it should not be optional.  Amazon has plenty of used copies under 15$. 15 Sep 2018 10:29 am: Jim Whitters
lucid and straightforward-----think it best that the course be presented once in the Spring and if it is a popular success present again next Fall or Spring, 2019.15 Sep 2018 2:54 pm: Barbara Burr
Excellent topic. Agree with above comments.  One can also buy on Amazon the”Complete Lyrics,” 1961-2016, for less than $20 if bought second hand, and many copies are available.  Agreetext should b e used; it is also inexpensive if bought 2nd hand.15 Sep 2018 4:41 pm: Dick Rubinstein
Ron’s right. Its 178 words. I’ll work with Kate to get it down to 150.
I will consult with the co-chairs about having two sections. The issue of course isn’t that exactly, but postponing the priority course selection, which seems like a bad precedent. What do you think about suggesting a single section, and repeating it in the Fall or Spring if it’s popular?16 Sep 2018 2:54 pm: Fred Chanania
From Fred C:  We should discuss this proposal soon as a Committee, but my initial reaction is that we should not recommend two sections of this class.  Perhaps we will be so sorely lacking in proposals for the spring that we may have plenty of open spots in the scheduling matrix, and that would make this somehow more attractive.  I do not anticipate this eventuality, and I think this may have some serious unintended consequences (for example, the self-nominated ""best"" SGLs with their 'loyal"" following may start to request the same type of preferential treatment at the potential expense of new SGLs).  Ultimately, Tess may have the final word as a matter of policy, but I think the CC views would be important for her to hear.  I, too, an very interested in hearing all views, especially opposing ones).  Meanwhile, comments on the proposal itself should proceed as the two section request does not interfere with our CC work at this stage.17 Sep 2018 10:51 am: Penny Revelle
The proposal is intriguing and should be well received but it comes in at 178 words.  I suggest deleting ""- songs as compensation for the realities of mortality,” as Harvard Professor Richard Thomas says in his book Why Bob Dylan Matters, the text for this class."" which is a great line but makes the sentence much too long.  The quote could be used prominently on the course web page.  Also that gets round saying it is the text for this class when the text is optional.  But, to this point, the text even though hardcover, is only $12 on Amazon, so I don't see any reason for listing it as optional. (Maybe that changed after Kate wrote her proposal?) 17 Sep 2018 2:04 pm: Katherine O'Connor
I am very wary of offering two sections of this course in one term - for all the reasons given and for additional concerns not stated. I agree that the Thomas book should be required, especially since the cost is hardly prohibitive. I frankly thought that the concluding sentence of the description was bizarre since it seems very unlikely to me that those who signed up would be looking for a course that trashed the Nobel Committee for giving Dylan the prize! Also, everything about the CD suggests that this is a course celebrating Dylan.17 Sep 2018 5:15 pm: Frank Speizer
Would agree with Ron and Mickey about buying the book. CD need to indicate homework time. Accept her proposal on having a deferred 1st choice if she teaches 2 sessions. (Although the suggestion of giving the course over 2 semesters would also work, but I would leave that preference to SGL. Nice to think about more flexibility in our program in general, and this may just be one example. ACCEPT17 Sep 2018 5:41 pm: David Bliss
I am sure this course will be popular, but we won't know how popular until after the schedule has been posted in the catalog.  So it would be better to postpone the second session until next fall.  The price of the book is not a real issue: used copies are available for under $20.
19 Sep 2018 8:31 am: Addison Stone
I agree that this is an attractive course proposal. Also agree that a second offering in fall 2019 is a better option for handling the (still hypothetical) demand. That would allow Tess to see how long the spring waitlist is. Re CD length, I agree with Penny about cutting the phrase from the Thomas quote. In addition to making the sentence quite long, I had trouble parsing the sentence with that phrase included. Two other possible cuts to bring the word length down: Cut ""Do not expect to sing...."", and also ""to bestow a Nobel Prize on Bob Dylan"" (obvious).22 Sep 2018 8:16 am: Susan Harris
I agree the book should be required and that a second session should not be offered until the fall.  Accept after editing for length as suggested above.  I do find it a bit odd that there will apparently be no listening to Dylan songs, but Kate has expressed a clear preference for focusing on lyrics alone and should be allowed to do that.  There is certainly enough meat for discussion in the lyrics alone.23 Sep 2018 9:35 am: Sara Freedman
Agree with the wise comments above. Suggestion to hold two sessions of the same class is bizarre, to me, as there are so many wonderful courses that I don't think members will mind if they don't get this course this particular semester. If there is indeed an oversubscription, she can offer it any following semester. Think sentence starting with ""Instead..."" is too long and winding. Needs to be two sentences or edit out quote from book. Idea of buying book with all of the lyrics seems an easy way around copyright issues. Making the book about Dylan required makes sense.23 Sep 2018 2:11 pm: Mickey Zemon
This is certainly a much improved proposal.  
Is there a reason she decided not to use the book?
I do not know how many lyrics Kate plans to copy but if these represent a large portion of his work she is pushing the limits of Fair Use.  It is better to have Gnomen make the copies and get the copyright clearance first.  This is what Judy Herman did in her poetry class.23 Sep 2018 5:54 pm: Dick Rubinstein

I’ll skip the Yiddish jokes. Michael has done it again: shifted gears to create a new subject in his series of literature seminars. Fabulous! Accept.

Now for the small things: Remove ""Three hours of reading a week,” from the CD. The system adds this automatically. Other Required Materials needs a period for the parenthetical sentence, some italics for the titles, and to be written out as a single paragraph.16 Sep 2018 2:58 pm: Fred Chanania

Wonderful proposal.  I hesitate to suggest a word change, but would Michael consider substituting resurrection for renaissance in the first sentence - just to continue the metaphor?17 Sep 2018 2:13 pm: Katherine O'Connor
Great idea for a course. My only quibblet is the opening ""Seemingly left for dead.."" I think this is too strong a metaphor for the state of Yiddish literature before its ""renaissance.""  It's certainly true that it is experiencing a ""renaissance"" but writers like Singer have been been consistently ""very much read."" 
Accept.17 Sep 2018 5:05 pm: Frank Speizer
Very little to add as I agree an outstanding SGL has done it again. We can be sure this one will be oversubscribed. I have one quibble. The second sentence says..”works consigned to the trash collector”. I fear that there will be a few members who might be offended as this might remind them of the 1930s book burnings, and it really doesn’t have to said this way. Leave it if Michael is comfortable but point it out to him.  With minor editsACCEPT18 Sep 2018 10:04 am: David Bliss
Bravo to a course that will bring a new canon of literature to HILR.  One question: The ""other preparation"" adds interest, but I am not sure if it will be included in the course catalog. If it is included, it will add significantly to the word limit for course proposals. 19 Sep 2018 8:01 am: Addison Stone
I agree that this is a winner. No editorial suggestions beyond what has already been mentioned. However, I wonder if there is a way to link the description more effectively to the title. I can see where the ""tears"" will come in, but I see no hints of the ""laughter"" in the course description.22 Sep 2018 8:23 am: Susan Harris
Another creative course idea from a fabulously popular SGL.  ""No knowledge of Yiddish required"" seems unnecessary in the CD.  Accept.23 Sep 2018 9:42 am: Sara Freedman
Wonderful course with terrific SGL. My one quibble is linking the haskelah with the emergence of Yiddish writers. They certainly benefited from the introduction of modern philosophy to Jewish life, including the new trends in writing such as the novel and the short story, but the haskelah to my knowledge is generally connected with championing the use of Hebrew, not Yiddish, as a modern means of communication and a plea for integrating Jews into their surrounding communities. Yiddish literature does not have these emphases, and much of it emphasizes the uniqueness of Jewish life and the need to retain that uniqueness in the light of  incursions from modernizing trends such as the Haskelah.24 Sep 2018 5:38 pm: Barbara Burr

"The Metaphysical Club","Approved","Addison Stone","406","","0","Spring 2019","Full Term","","Philosophy","In the early 1870s, a small group of scientists, lawyers, and philosophers met regularly near the Harvard campus to discuss urgent issues of the day. Known as “The Metaphysical Club,” the group included such luminaries as William James, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., and Charles S. Peirce. Of special concern were two large questions: (1) In an intellectual environment dominated by scientific and technological approaches to the world, does ethics any longer have a secure foundation? (2) In an increasingly diverse and democratic political order, what is the proper role of intellectual elites? The group’s intense discussions gave birth to America’s distinctive contribution to philosophical thought – Pragmatism – with its emphasis on practical modes of thinking: open, experimental, fallible, tolerant, heuristic, and self-corrective. In our study group, we will explore the central ideas of Pragmatism and consider its continuing influence on American culture. Class meetings will consist largely of discussion.","3","","Kenneth","","Winston","","kenneth_winston@hks.harvard.edu","617-714-5908","1","","","","","","","","","","Louis Menand|Pragmatism: A Reader|Vintage|1997|","Louis Menand|The Metaphysical Club|Farrar, Straus and Giroux|2001|","","","","<strong>Readings: </strong>Louis Menand, <em>Pragmatism: A Reader</em>&nbsp;(Vintage, 1997); Louis Menand, <em>The Metaphysical Club</em>&nbsp;(Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2001).","Estimated outside work is three hours per week.

Nice topic. I would rewrire second sentence to begin “ A small group of friends met... Could he just put the Emerson essays on the web site to eliminate the need for the purchase of the third book?13 Sep 2018 7:42 pm: Dick Rubinstein
Yes, an interesting proposal. The fourth sentence goes on and on, and needs to be broken up. While his education in the bio is relevant to the topic, how about a sentence about how he became interested in this topic?13 Sep 2018 7:57 pm: Mickey Zemon
Cambridge, Massachusetts -- there is another Cambridge where intellectuals gather
Second sentence and last sentence say pretty much the same thing, so delete one or the other
A one sentence definition of pragmatism should be added to the proposal
Divide up that long 4th sentence -- for instance, a period after Metaphysical Club.  Next sentence: These members, including William James . . . , engaged in intense discussions on the place of religion and morality ... and the place of intellectual elites ....
This sounds like a very interesting course by a very well qualified person who is a relatively new member of HILR.
This is obviously a 12 week class but I do not see where it says that above.


13 Sep 2018 9:07 pm: Jim Whitters
Interesting subject. 4th sentence is cluttered---break it up for clarity.13 Sep 2018 10:14 pm: Barbara Burr
Good proposal but weak 1st sentence.  There were probably scads of things that the intellectuals of Cambridge MA were thing about...Maybe refer to to the  philosphical, ethical and social questions raised by the changing events of that time...14 Sep 2018 7:04 am: Dick Rubinstein
Mickey: This is a full-term course. That information is directly under the title. That you missed it suggests to me that it’s in a bad place. I missed it too! Thanks!14 Sep 2018 10:27 am: Barbara Burr
“Thing” should obviously be “thinking” in my comment...14 Sep 2018 10:53 am: Susan Harris
Interesting course.  I agree that the fourth sentence is too long and that “Massachusetts” should be added.  The other suggested changes strike me as matters of personal preference -- things that we might suggest but should not insist on.14 Sep 2018 11:37 am: Linda Neumann
Agree that the first sentence does not really introduce us to the topic.  Fourth sentence should be broken up in order to beter emphasize the issues which appear at the end and seem to be the heart of this course.  Like it.14 Sep 2018 12:15 pm: Linda Neumann
Two more points.  Is he planning on lectures or discussions?  Any special reaon he limits to 12 participants?  I think there could be healthy demand for this course.16 Sep 2018 2:45 pm: Fred Chanania
Addison:  I don't usually comment on proposals at this stage but I wanted to tell you that, since you are new to the CC, this proposal is pretty lacking in my view.   I do not find this ""interesting"" or ""attractive"" for most HILR'ers.   It is true that the SGL has identified the topic and some critical questions or themes that will be ""explored"" but that's as far as it goes in terms of:  what will the SGMs experience in class?  how will the readings be used in terms of the focus of a class, or just as an adjunct to the discussion?  how much prep time is expected?  what is the relevance of the course to today's pressing problems (or is it just for history buffs and there is not much meat to provoke thinking about today's world).  It's not enough to have the throw away sentence at the end of the CD saying it's relevant to today.  How is it going to be relevant?  If a person is absolutely interested in this slice of philosophical history, they may take this class but there is no ""selling point"" for a regular person to get excited about.  Personally, I am not sure this will attract the minimum number of sign-ups, so I think that the SGL needs to figure out how to entice folks into taking this course.   17 Sep 2018 11:23 am: Penny Revelle
I agree that the first, second and last sentences are weak in terms of drumming up member interest, but disagree  that the CD as written wouldn't draw much interest from the members - the mention of the authors to be discussed should ensure that. (I like the idea of including Emerson and maybe a sentence about how his work would be used - in contrast to the pragmatists?) However, I think a definition of pragmatism would help and could be a first sentence.17 Sep 2018 2:20 pm: Katherine O'Connor
Weak concluding sentence, too long second-to-last sentence, and yes, there is more than one Cambridge. Otherwise, I think it's a great subject for a SG. 17 Sep 2018 5:23 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with last 3-4 comments. The subject could be interesting but the CD needs a re-write to give it more meat and a suggestion on perspectives that will be discussed.  Extra gratuitous remake after philosophy degrees should go. 17 Sep 2018 5:28 pm: David Bliss
Here is a question that might help to focus the CD: How did 19th century Americans switch from idealistic  transcendentalism to pragmatic social science?  After the civil war, they threw out the received Biblical wisdom of our ancestors for a new pragmatism based on experience.  Good topic and good books.18 Sep 2018 9:17 am: Helen Bakeman
With a better course description, I believe tat this will be a popular course. First sentence should start with something about pragmatism, as in What could be more American than a philosophy of  pragmatism?  Then go on to the 3rd sentence and  also a definition of pragmatism in comparison to what had come before. Bio—take out date of his retirement18 Sep 2018 3:40 pm: Jim Whitters
superb subject for a course but concur with the above comments recommending a re-write with more substance.23 Sep 2018 9:47 am: Sara Freedman
Agree with Fred's comments. SGL seems supremely qualified but he may be so steeped in the subject matter that he assumes others know more about the topic than they actually do. Course has wonderful potential but needs a good discussion of pragmatism, specific examples of intriguing topics that the course will explore, and specific ways it will address topics important to today.  24 Sep 2018 8:55 am: Addison Stone
