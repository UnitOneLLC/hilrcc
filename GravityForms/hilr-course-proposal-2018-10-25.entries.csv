Do you agree with Reich?  Do you agree with his recommendations for the solution?  Is the loss of the ""Common Good"" the reason for the loss of bipartisanship in Congress and civility in the political process?  Let us brain-storm some creative ways to re-engage for the ""Common Good"".

David:  you have a bit of work on this one in the CD, but shouldn't be too tough.  Bigger problem is bio with all those degrees and the overall length.  Furthermore, nothing in the bio relates to the course.  You might suggest to Margo that, rather than recite her work history, she tell a short story about why she is motivated to offer a course on this topic.25 Oct 2018 3:33 pm: Addison Stone
Could be an interesting class, though it runs the risk of being a bit superficial and/or scattered. Reich's book is quite short (180 pages), but Margo mentions additional readings from those recommended by Reich, so there could be enough 'meat' here. Hopefully, Margo is an effective discussion leader. The CD reads nicely, but of course it needs to be cut. Lots of options for deleting phrases or even a whole sentence or two. Agree with Fred re the Bio.25 Oct 2018 4:27 pm: Penny Revelle
Intriguing CD, although too long.  Too many questions. I would delete ""Can we function as a democracy without some common ground? "" and ""Do you agree with Reich?"" and ""Do you agree with his recommendations for the solution? "" (reader presumably hasn't read the book yet and so couldn't have an opinion)
But I would also change the first sentence to ""The common good is up front and center------""and change the 4th sentence to read ""--accountable for its disregard--""  because now you would have too many repeats of ""The Common Good""25 Oct 2018 4:39 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree with Penny's edits, especially the first sentence and cutting out repetition.25 Oct 2018 4:53 pm: Frank Speizer
Take out 1st and last sentences drops 20 words. Otherwise I think she covers the topic. Problem might be some political controversy among SGMs but I think the book perspectives might control that. Agree problem is in bio. Fred’s idea would be great if it can work.

David, that makes sense. He could also add a little to flesh out the course.
 Based on his message to us, wouldn’t it make sense to have a co-sgl?25 Oct 2018 3:24 pm: Addison Stone
An ambitious topic. More than enough for a single full-term SG. Not sure how he'll pull it off, but he has both the knowledge and practical pedagogical experience to make it happen, I suspect. It would be good to say something about the format of the class sessions: lectures? Note that he says under other preparation that the Powell book is optional, so it should be listed as a required reading. In the Bio, could delete the last sentence, though it's amusing.25 Oct 2018 4:13 pm: Penny Revelle
Maybe change unless provoked in the bio to unless pestered.
I  don't think the study group could listen to 1000 years of Western Art music, so perhaps the second sentence should read "" We will select from and discuss 1000 years of Western Art music.""
Do we allow underlining (sentence one). or maybe it could be italicized?
Sounds like a very nice course by a well qualified leader.25 Oct 2018 4:36 pm: Barbara Burr
A fine survey. First sentence could read: ..""is intended for anyone (no underline) who has an interest in learning more about classical music."" The next very long sentence  could be a number of shorter sentences. I agree there seem to be about 4 main topics.  25 Oct 2018 5:05 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with Penny and Barbara to much being promised for what sounds like an interesting but casual course to enjoy music.

Well written and clear.  Since access to the course website is a requirement, will there be documents posted there?  If so, then the other required materials should include words about postings on the website.  ""Other preparation"" does not show up in the catalog.25 Oct 2018 2:24 pm: Ron Ebert
I am puzzled about the two course structure, despite her explanation. I doubt she can get her wish for parallel scheduling otherwise. In addition, combining the two removes the taint of a how to course.25 Oct 2018 2:34 pm: Mickey Zemon
This is such a great idea for a study group.
I agree with David's comment above.  Also, I think it is a given that all members need good internet access for most study groups.
Family history research in the first sentence -- can you replace that with Genealogy or just Researching your family's history . . .
No experience is required -- could you be more specific about what this means  -- experience building a family tree, using online genealogical resources, other?
Will class members need to buy a subscription to the subscription-based Ancestry website you mention in the CD?  If so, might want to mention cost. 25 Oct 2018 3:56 pm: Addison Stone
This course certainly sounds 'meatier' than many how-to courses, but it strikes me as indeed a skills course. I wouldn't argue against it, but it does seem that we need to have a general discussion about what is, and what is not, an appropriate how-to offering at some point soon. 
The CD is nicely written. No need to provide the name of the book in the CD since it will show up as required. Re the issue of two independent SGs, does Susan really want folks in the writing course who haven't undertaken the kind of detailed research that she is asking for in her own SG? Are the two SGs really independent?25 Oct 2018 4:46 pm: Penny Revelle
Ancestry site use is pretty expensive (approx $300/year for international records access) but I guess she assuming that some interested SGMs will already have a subscription.

I was working with Annie before, but she went ahead and re-submitted. Perhaps some words about the books:
La Peste tells the story of a plague sweeping the French Algerian city of Oran. It asks a number of questions relating to the nature of destiny and the human condition.
L'Etat de Siege is s a play in three acts presenting the arrival of plague, personified by a young opportunist, in sleepy Cadiz, and the subsequent creation of a totalitarian regime through the manipulation of fear.
25 Oct 2018 3:10 pm: Addison Stone
I'm confused. Has she withdrawn the earlier version based on Moliere? Are there two courses? 
The start of this CD is rather flat and strange. Is the focus on practicing French or on Camus? Why use Camus for this purpose? Mickey's edits will help with the prose that IS here, but an effective lead-in re rationale and scope is missing. Change ""oral expose"" to ""oral report.""25 Oct 2018 3:55 pm: Helen Bakeman
I am guessing that Annie has talked to some of her French language buddies and they felt that Camus was preferable to Moliere to provide grist for oral reports. Even if the Camu books are a jumping off point for speaking French, they need to be treated more seriously in the CD, as David suggests. Agree with Mickey’s edits.25 Oct 2018 4:05 pm: Penny Revelle

Hers are stories of courtship within an identifiable world of money and property sketched with sometimes brutal realism. W.H. Auden famously recorded shock at seeing a middle-class spinster ""reveal so frankly and with such sobriety / the economic basis of society."" We will discuss four of Austen's novels in their economic contexts. Where did Darcy’s £10,000 pounds come from every year? Was Emma being foolish or financially savvy in preferring to remain unmarried? Was Mansfield Park built with money from the slave trade (and what was Sir Thomas Bertram doing in Antigua anyway)?

Citron expects that some members of the committee might raise questions about the amount of reading.  To which she responds that most people are likely to have read at least 2 of the Austen novels; Persuasion and Pride and Prejudice are quite short; Austen is not heavy going; and people will have the summer to read ahead.  The Austen material is shorter and easier than was the Brontë material a couple years ago and members didn't have any trouble with the Brontë stuff.  Similarly, a few years ago, people in Purloined Letters read Daniel Deronda and The Portrait of a Lady in what turned out to be a 10 week semester when we lost 2 weeks to snow storms.  People who take novel courses are readers and Austen is hardly late James.","24 Oct 2018 7:01 pm: Fred Chanania

Seems like a good topic and an SGL with lots of relevant experience to draw on. Agree with Mickey's suggested edits. The publisher is indeed Apress (missing capital). Limited availability of the paperback, which is relatively expensive ($35-$40), but Kindle is available. Some edits:
Sentence 1: comma after D.C.
Should ""What skills do these entities bring..."" be ""What skills do these individuals bring...""?
List of questions is rather long. One possibility is to drop one of the two questions about payment.
In ""What are some of the cases that lobbyists have worked either for the government or groups out of it?"", need to insert comma after ""worked"" and insert ""for"" before groups.
In last sentence, could omit the opening phrase ""As you can imagine.""

Great idea.  The CD is short and could use some indication of required preparation.

Looks like a worthwhile course. I agree with Mickey's edits, and with Susan's question about the books. Will they in fact be a part of the class activity, or is the class really all lecture? If the latter, then the books should be optional rather than required. Also, why two books covering the same territory? The fact that the first sentence presupposes info in the title is a bit awkward. What about deleting the names of the countries from the title and starting the first sentence as ""Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt surround the hornet's nest...."" To liven things up, the sentence beginning ""Our goal will be..."" could be recast as a series of questions.23 Oct 2018 3:24 pm: Penny Revelle

Although lecture courses are not our norm, I am sure this class will meet a high educational standard.  I am taking his course on Harvard architecture and he is a fountain of information.

If he wants people to do some reading from the suggested books, he should pick one of the two books and put it in the book section;  if optional, is it ok if people read no book? The word “invited” seems to say that.  If one of the books gives a good overall view of the countries and issues to be addresssed in class, I hope that he decides to make one required.

I think advanced French makes a good SG - are there enough members for this?  The first sentence should specify plays will be read in French.  Might say a little as to why these plays were selected for the conversation course.  Also, the particular editions should be added to ""Books""...Maybe in the bio she can say what she taught - French language?23 Oct 2018 9:34 am: Helen Bakeman
There is a small active group of advanced French speakers/literature folks that will likely join Annie.  Need a first sentence about the joys of reading Moliere in French.  Then say more about what sorts of things the discussion will focus on.  Delete last two sentences. Books need to be fixed.  Maybe replace  last sentence in bio with something about her love of Moliere plays.23 Oct 2018 10:15 am: Addison Stone
Not sure about whether this will draw the requisite number of students to ""go."" If there is limited availability of small seminar rooms, I would rank this SG lower in priority. I'd like the CD to explain why Moliere was chosen. Also, should mention something about issues for discussion (e.g., content vs. style; satire of French society??). The literature side of this SG needs a bit more emphasis.  Change opening sentence to ""We will read the original French versions of...."" Note that there are actually two required books. Should be separate entries, along with info re the relevant editions. In Bio, what did SGL teach? Could eliminate or at least shorten the mention of degree in international development at Tufts.23 Oct 2018 10:43 am: Katherine O'Connor
I think that this is a great idea. I would guess that there will be enough takers to have the course go. It would be a good idea to say something about why Moliere and these two plays have been chosen. Presumably she thinks they're good stimulants for conversation - why? Also, maybe one sentence about what aspects of the text will be focused on in class.  I don't think more is needed here than that. Accept.23 Oct 2018 10:51 am: Sara Freedman
Agree with above comments about need to provide more information about the literary issues that will be discussed and why the two plays were chosen for the class. Could be a terrific course for French speakers, of whom there are many in HILR. Bio should be less on degrees and more on experience in enjoying and teaching the topic.23 Oct 2018 11:18 am: Mickey Zemon
I agree with above comments.  Enhance the proposal with more info about Moliere and these two plays.
Delete the last two sentences since that info is covered under Workload and Limits.
Books: include publication info and dates in correct space
Bio: change s to S in first sentence.  Trim it.
Accept23 Oct 2018 11:32 am: Frank Speizer
Agree must indicate early that this is all in French. Also agree ther is a large enough cadre of French speakers.  However crossing that with Moliere will restrict numbers further so need to beef up why thes plays.  Should probably include som provocative question that would make me as a no French speaker jealous that I can’t take the course. Given CD modifications ACCEPT23 Oct 2018 12:48 pm: Susan Harris
This CD is only 68 words long and needs to be fleshed out along the lines discussed above.  I took a course in French here (about the concept of love in French literature) with different SGLs.  It was full (18 people?).  I tried to take a previous class in French about Moliere and did not get in.  I do think there are plenty of French speakers to fill a course unless you take the title's ""advanced conversation"" literally.  I think SGL should open it to people who consider themselves ""intermediate"" if she wants it to attract enough members.23 Oct 2018 3:32 pm: Penny Revelle
Good idea to open it to ""intermediate"" French speakers.
Need to take out the things that go somewhere else in the catalogue description: additional materials, class size and amount of reading and replace with something about why these plays and the discussion questions they might stimulate.
The books need to be in required format23 Oct 2018 4:10 pm: Linda Neumann
How about just ""French Conversation"" without ""advanced"" or ""intermediate""?  Anyone reading the CD will be able to judge if her/his French is good enough.  
Once you take out the ""additional material"", preparation time and ""class size is limited to 18"", she is left with about 45 words.  She has plenty of space to write more about the plays, why chosen, are they similar or different, what will be discussed.
Can take out the degree from Fletcher in the bio.23 Oct 2018 4:53 pm: Ron Ebert
Yes, just french conversation and let sgms decide for themselves. Expand cd as suggested and trim bio.24 Oct 2018 7:50 pm: David Bliss

An alluring CD, nicely crafted. Like Barbara, I wonder how all of this will be accomplished in 6 weeks. Perhaps the excerpts under Other Prep are short?23 Oct 2018 9:23 am: Helen Bakeman
Wonderful topic and it should work in 6 weeks (or expand to 10 weeks and include fairy tales from other cultures??? Probably not but would be fascinating.) 23 Oct 2018 10:48 am: David Bliss
Excellently written course description.  There should be a mention of the course reader in other required materials, since the course packet may be an additional cost.

Great.  As to Kindle reading, note that, for recent big-publisher books, the Kindle versions match the print version of a particular edition, even including matching page numbers.  For example, the Kindle version of Grimm Reader    has ""2010"" on the copyright page and the same page numbers as the print version.  I don't think we need to say specifically that the Kindle version is acceptable but am not opposed to it either.  Accept.23 Oct 2018 3:36 pm: Penny Revelle

Be interesting to see how his class went last spring.  This one certainly sounds interesting.23 Oct 2018 10:57 am: Sara Freedman
Sounds like a fine course but CD does not convey the enthusiasm that the leader certainly feels about these films, the themes that unit them, and their aesthetic value. Agree that good opening sentence or two might provide this overview and sense of what the experience of the course will be like.23 Oct 2018 11:08 am: David Bliss
What about self and culture?  It would be better to start out with a question tying the course title to the objective of the course. I assume that ""other Prep"" is actually Other required material, because it should appear in the catalog.23 Oct 2018 11:20 am: Katherine O'Connor
I think that the idea behind this course is very interesting. It certainly is a film course that has a specific focus. The writing, however, especially in the opening two sentences is flat. Also, I find the comment about the films not being chosen for their emotional impact odd.  What does that mean? That a film having or not having an emotional impact is irrelevant? Also, don't film viewers themselves react to films in different ways? Supposing if the viewers are overwhelmed by the emotional effect of a film but the SGL is not, what then? Wouldn't that contrast then become part of the discussion?
Accept with suggested edits23 Oct 2018 1:06 pm: Susan Harris
I like the idea of showing two movies from each of three very different cultures - should lead to rich discussions.  I agree it needs a better opener.   I agree with the ""oddness"" of saying the films ""were chosen more for what they demonstrate about a culture and less for emotional impact"" and don't think the phrase adds anything.  I like that the course will start early at times rather than spilling over into the lunch hour.23 Oct 2018 2:27 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree particularly with last two reviewers. Also had trouble with opening that mentions the director. There must be several directors. Clearly a film course but seems to have theme. Modify and ACCEPT 


23 Oct 2018 3:53 pm: Penny Revelle
Agree it needs an opening sentence such as: ""Foreign films provide a clear window into the culture from which they come as well as intriguing and sometimes alternative views of human nature.""  Then take out the sentence about emotional impact.
Otherwise seems like a  well focused film course.23 Oct 2018 4:43 pm: Ron Ebert
Edits above make sense. I would get rid of the three “both”. Also Tess is clear that we cannot start early and running into noon hour is a problem also ( most film rooms booked for noon hour). Can he rethink his timing- could he stop before the end and restart following week, for example?23 Oct 2018 4:46 pm: Linda Neumann

The French writer Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette married a man fourteen years her senior in 1893.  She was twenty and he was almost thirty-four, a jaded man-about town. Henri Gautier-Villars: Parisian author, publisher, and libertine, pen name ""Willy,"" made his living off a stable of poorly paid writers whose work he published in his own name. Though in the course of her career, Colette was to become a celebrated literary icon, she was fresh from a backwater in Burgundy when she married him. Ignorant of Parisian ways, she found herself broke and alone as her husband cavorted with other women. Dependent on Willy for her every need, she could only go along when he locked her in a room to force her to write the Claudine stories, the first of her career. Willy published them in his own name, secured the copyright, and used the money from their enormous success to support a lavish lifestyle while his wife lived in penury. In ""The Muse and the Money"" we'll read about this time in Colette's life and discuss how she survived.

Yes, she needs to cut out quite a bit of the biography and mention more about the Claudine stories.  Bio also need to be shortened.

The Willy story is fascinating, and could be the focus of the SG, but I think it needs to be more clear in the CD whether the main idea for the SG is her bio or her fiction, or some balance between the two. Obviously needs to be shorter in any event.23 Oct 2018 8:32 am: Addison Stone
Great topic and knowledgeable SGL. Unlike others, I don’t have a problem with clarity of the focus. Obviously, both CD and Bio need cutting. In the CD, could delete sentences 3 and 6. Also, delete “secured the copyright,” and “In The Muse and the Money.” That takes care of 40 words. Beyond that, some sentence tightening should get the size down to 150ish. In the Bio, could cut the second sentence. Not sure how easy it will be to get necessary number of copies of the second book. Will she use all of it? Could selections be scanned?23 Oct 2018 12:55 pm: Susan Harris
I agree that we should let Susan cut this down by 25% before we expend too much effort on a revision. 23 Oct 2018 2:19 pm: David Bliss
I looked for the book, My Apprenticeships &amp; Music-Hall Sidelights, and there are very few available. One at Widener. It might be possible to scan parts of the book and distribute through Gnomon Copy.23 Oct 2018 4:07 pm: Penny Revelle
I agree we need less biography anymore about why Colette was a writer worth studying.  Maybe:
""In the course of her career, Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette became a celebrated literary icon, who showed us -----------------------------But  she was fresh from a backwater in Burgundy when she married Henri Gautier-Villars: Parisian author, publisher, and libertine. ""Willy"" locked her in a room to force her to write the Claudine stories, then published them in his own name, secured the copyright, and used the money from their enormous success to support a lavish lifestyle while his wife lived in penury. In ""The Muse and the Money"" we'll read about this time in Colette's life and discuss how she survived. We'll watch the 2018 film, ""Colette,"" and we'll study her first four stories, the Claudine series.""

bio: Susan LaDue discovered Colette while teaching French at UMass, Boston, when the field of women's studies was just getting started.   She lobbied to include Colette in the Women's Studies curriculum and published a paper about Colette's struggle to survive.23 Oct 2018 4:36 pm: Ron Ebert
Davids idea to use gnomon makes sense. Penny’s rewrite is fine and showing some ( or all) of the movie is a nice addition.

This should be very enjoyable and historically interesting.  A better and more lively first sentence would be a big help (""selection of six gardens are selected..."" doesn't read very well).  A little more on the framework used for studying and comparing the gardens would also be helpful22 Oct 2018 7:33 pm: Linda Neumann
Agree with Barbara about 1st sentence and he has plenty of words left to say a few words about the development or uses of gardens in different periods.22 Oct 2018 10:33 pm: Helen Bakeman
In addition to a better first sentence and more substance (why were these six selected, how will they be compared, framework for discussing the gardens, etc), I don’t think that the last sentence adds anything. Bio—if the wide-ranging travel schedule is to visit gardens, say so.22 Oct 2018 10:35 pm: Sara Freedman
Agree that first sentence is awkward...selected for what? Refreshing that topic is one not offered this term, and Rick has a good reputation in his field and in teaching here.23 Oct 2018 8:05 am: Addison Stone
Agree re need for a stronger first sentence and a bit more detail regarding the SGL's orientation toward the material. Why these six gardens (the book covers 20), and what is the analytic framework? Also agree that the last sentence should go. Bio should definitely mention visits to gardens around the world, if appropriate. Might also mention previous SGs on garden design. Could he say something about the ""other readings""?23 Oct 2018 11:19 am: David Bliss
Rick is an accomplished landscape designer.  The CD should include some words about how garden typology has common features over time and over differing locations.  The title seems to tell what is to be the theme of the course. I took his course before, and he showed many nice slides, but had difficulty allowing class discussion to get started. 23 Oct 2018 11:30 am: Katherine O'Connor
I agree that the first sentence is the opposite of an alluring opener. One sentence related to the reasons behind this particular choice of gardens would be desirable. I was disappointed to hear David's comment about the SGL's difficulties re initiating discussion. Does he make questions on the weekly assignments available on the website? Wouldn't that help to launch some discussion?
Accept with edits. 23 Oct 2018 12:37 pm: Susan Harris
Could be an good course but the CD (only 95 words) could be more interesting and informative.  I think the title is dull and don't know why ""Garden"" is singular in it.  Agree with comments above re first sentence and the need for more about what connects the gardens to be studied.  Agree with bio suggestions.23 Oct 2018 4:21 pm: Penny Revelle
Gardens and their design can tell us much about what a culture values and how its members like to spend their time.  We will study six gardens, located from Peru to the American colonies and created from 1522 to 1720.  They include ------.  ---------  Assignments will include -----

I took his previous garden class, too and agree that he could use some help including discussion in the class if he wants to.  He seemed perfectly happy lecturing and answered questions readily and it was interesting.  Actually  I thought the greatest disconnect between what the SGMs expected and what he presented is that they wanted some advice on how to include elements of the gardens studied into their own gardens.  23 Oct 2018 4:31 pm: Ron Ebert
I like penny’s rewrite. His further information might be inserted to clarify course goal. I too have taken his classes and again, penny is correct- he is interesting and many sgms want garden advice.

Borges, like many of his contemporaries, was sophisticated, world-traveled, multi-lingual, and multi-talented.  His intellectual interests lay in European thought and philosophy - English, German, Spanish, and French.  HIs literary interests were even more widespread, American, Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon, Irish nationalist, Eastern European, and Near Eastern.  We shall see all these elements in what we tackle. The short stories make up in intensity for their brevity.  They are fun, bizarre, curious, and profound.  Discussions depend on our collective imaginations and our willingness to walk through the looking-glass.  Brush up on your medieval Arabian history, the Kabbala and Irish uprisings!  Philosophy majors welcomed.","2","","Richard","","Berger","","richard.s.berger@gmail.com","617 519 5606","3 or more","","","","","","","","","","Borges, Jorge Luis|Ficciones|Grove Press|1994|x","Borges, Jorge Luis|The Aleph and Other Stories|Penguin|2004|xNo","","","","<strong>Readings: </strong>Only these editions: Borges, Jorge Luis, <em>Ficciones</em>&nbsp;(Grove Press, 1994); Borges, Jorge Luis, <em>The Aleph and Other Stories</em>&nbsp;(Penguin, 2004).","Estimated outside work is two hours per week.

He was fully immersed in the Latin American world ever since. Yes, innocently taking Spanish courses as if it were a random academic choice. But six years? Let us not be so credulous! And his <i>studies</i> abroad? I should say! He was operating in Peru for his first palace revolution in 1962. Was present at the Christian Democratic Chilean landslide of 1964 and breezily walked through a Buenos Aires park as another military leader was sacked in 1970. Three innocent years abroad? Coincidence? I think not. After untold <i>visits</i> to Central, Caribbean and South America and though in deep undercover for the last forty years--in public schools he says--drilling in Spanish colonial history, national transformations, social revolutions, and the Spanish language, the secretive don Ricardo has disavowed me, us, his handlers, and has retired to a simpler life disentangling Latin American reality.

Each set of readings is accompanied by a series of open-ended questions about meaning, structure, language, pace, and context.  Class depends on participant observations based on textual references.  In addition, Borges indirectly asks ""What is fiction, what is real, what is a reader, and what is a writer?""  If Borges writes a story in which he appears, is he ""real"" or part of the fiction?  Even better, does the reader change as s/he reads?

Get rid of third sentence to eliminate confusion of “they”. Now about the bio....Linda , you have a bit of work ahead of you. Should be a very good class. I like the second and third to the end sentences, but not the final one.22 Oct 2018 4:57 pm: Helen Bakeman
Agree re: 3rd sentence. Not sure what to do with “boom”—I suggest that we leave it in quotation marks and consistently capitalize it. First word in one of the middle sentences is “His”...need to make second letter lower case. Second to last sentence—should be Arabic rather than Arabian. Make Other Required Readings the standard.

Excellent SGL with an exciting topic. A person doesn't ""explore"" into the world, in any less than dire circumstances. His work can. Add ""work"" after Borges' in his first sentence instead. The ""American"" in the second sentence should be U.S. as much of Latin America did recognize his work. Can get rid of sentence beginning with ""Our world..."" as it repeats much of previous sentence. Would note that there are two different kinds of readings - the first is a very varied compilation and the second is short stories. It seems that both can be described with the adjectives he uses for the short stories alone... As for the bio, ....22 Oct 2018 5:07 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with above on sentences that can be dropped.Particularly last.  Regarding the bio, I suggest rather than offer anything just tell him to come back with no more than 50-60 words that will be edited, and if he exceeds that the proposal will not be considered.  Let him do the work. 22 Oct 2018 6:09 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree with Sara about explode.  Would cut out the second explosion and rephrase.  Is ""boom"" capitalized or not capitalized?  What about non-philosophy majors?!  The second and third sentences can be combined.  I'm sure it will be a good course.  The bio reads like an overly long study group proposal about the SGL!  I am sure he can rewrite.22 Oct 2018 8:55 pm: Mickey Zemon
Agree with Ron -- delete third sentence.
Middle sentence starting with His intellectual interests: need a -- two dashes between philosophy and English
Next sentence: replace HIs with his; suggest -- between widespread and American not a comma
Delete: We shall see all these elements in what we tackle.
Third sentence from end: Discussions WILL depend

Great topic. Agree about deleting third sentence. Could also get rid of the final sentence, and perhaps also the penultimate one. In the fifth sentence, seems that a dash would be better than a comma after ""widespread."" Agree to give SGL the challenge of confining his biography to the word limit. Clever, but for another venue.23 Oct 2018 11:38 am: Katherine O'Connor
Borges is  great topic. The writing is unclear in the first two sentences. The CD can certainly be trimmed!  How do we respond to the bio? Accept with edits.23 Oct 2018 12:29 pm: Susan Harris
In 2nd sentence change ""for many years"" to ""for decades"" and then eliminate the third sentence.  De-capitalize the first ""Boom"" to make it match the second.  I would delete last sentence.  Agree with Mickey's edits.  Agree send bio back to Richard (if he exists).23 Oct 2018 4:34 pm: Penny Revelle
I would delete the penultimate sentence - I would expect him to include some of this material in the additional required materials posted on the class website rather than to assume the SGMs will brush up on it before the class starts.
I think the bio is amusing and gives potential SGMs an idea of his personality but tell him to publish it on the class website (early, so they can read it while deciding on course choices) and give us something in 50 words or less.

It will be fascinating, especially for non scientists.  The basic facts (speculations?) are relatively simple to understand conceptually, although the explanations are baffling to scientists.

Turn the first two sentences into questions. What is  the big picture -- the really big picture --provided by contemporary cosmology?

I think this is very good the way it is but I don't object to the suggestions made above.  I like the first sentence.

Modest revisions.  ACCEPT 22 Oct 2018 5:39 pm: David Bliss
The CD needs to introduce the name of the author in the first sentence.  Here is a possible Bio for John to consider:

John Ehrenfeld has been writing books (2+) about sustainability and flourishing in the world. This inquiry has taken him from his engineering roots into the realms of philosophy and biology, where he is personally flourishing in the rich possibilities of the world.22 Oct 2018 6:21 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree that there should be a clear first sentence that gives the lay of the land re the author and the two books, and then give the quote etc.  Does ""modernity"" have a structure? What does ""its failings"" relate to?  Some clearer syntax will be a big help.  Dave has already helped with the bio.22 Oct 2018 6:28 pm: Mickey Zemon
I do not know anything about the works of Daniel Quinn and would like an introductory sentence explaining who he is and why I would want to read his novels.  I would skip the first two sentences and go right to the third one, and then follow with  info about the two novels.  As for the roller coaster ride sentence at the end of the CD -- suggest replacing it with one that is more specific about the content and style of these novel.  23 Oct 2018 11:54 am: Susan Harris
Agree that the opening needs to give a better overview of the course (2 novels by Quinn) and the author - I never heard of him.  Why should I read him?  Ishmael was described by one critic as a ""fascinating and odd book - not a novel by any conventional definition.""  Its unconventionality might be better addressed directly than as ""not Forster or Hemingway""  and a ""roller-coaster"" ride.  I like David's rewrite of the bio. Agree fix ""its failings.""23 Oct 2018 11:57 am: Katherine O'Connor
I agree that the CD needs to introduce us to Quinn sooner than it does. I, in fact, agree with most of the comments. I, like Barbara, didn't know what the ""its failings"" referred to. Also, I wasn't sure about the books accessing our ""hidden beliefs""? This sounds vaguely insinuating to me, but this may be my problem. The CD needs  some work.23 Oct 2018 4:36 pm: Linda Neumann
Agree that the proposer should introduce Quinn and his books at the beginning.  Apparently Ismael is a Socratic dialog between a man and an ape - not your conventional novel - and provoked controversy in the literary world.  
The sentence ""We will use the books as an access to our hidden beliefs, and to some alternate ways to hold and heal the world""  is nebulous to me.  What are ways to ""hold the world?""  23 Oct 2018 4:53 pm: Penny Revelle
Yes, needs a better first sentence. Maybe something like ""Daniel Quinn is a writer who is not afraid to confront the social and environmental malaise increasingly visible during our time on Earth.""
Then go on to: ""In his novel, Ishmael, which starts out with the strange ad, “TEACHER SEEKS PUPIL. Must have an earnest desire to save the world. Apply in person,” we are taken on a voyage back to beginning of human civilization.  His second novel, The Story of B------""
Should also get in the word sustainability someplace in the CD because I gather that is part of what he means by flourishing, and what intends to discuss, but that is not at all clear in the CD as it stands.

Could leave out the last sentence which doesn't add much.  I doubt if either Forster or Hemingway were much concerned with flourishing in the sense that Quinn uses it.","false","","145","2018-10-22 12:48:51","https://ccsubmit.com/","","","","","","Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:62.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/62.0","173.76.102.87","","complete","complete","","","pending","","","","","","","pending","13","1540237479"

I love the idea of this class. In addition to Mickey’s comments.....First sentence—“all” seems wrong to describe literature;  how about “.....World War I, situated on the Western Front and immersed in trench warfare.”22 Oct 2018 12:01 am: Barbara Burr
Excellent topic and well-described.  Agree with leaving out ""all""... My only concern pertains to whether the course would be OK for someone lacking detailed knowledge of WWI, or whether sufficient background will be provided by the SGL so that these books can be compared to the ""classics"" as he proposes in the CD (assuming a member hasn't read the classics).  22 Oct 2018 10:37 am: Penny Revelle
Good to see such a well written CD.

Nonetheless:
1. leave out the sentence on reading per week.
2.Make Mickey's suggested change in the first sentence.
3. I wonder if he would consider a 10 week course? He seems have ore than enough material, especially if he includes videos as he states.22 Oct 2018 11:13 am: Linda Neumann
Interesting topic and good CD.  Dan, as a first time SGL, gave a course on children in Nazi Germany in the same format last year.   We read three short books, two of them autobiographical, and it was excellent.  He skillfully interspersed videos and background material.  I think six weeks is fine.

Go with Mickey's wordsmithing. Not that I was put off by the suggestion that the authors mentioned, mostly unknown to me, are not saying something different, but it did make me ask myself ""Do I know enough to take this course"" I agree with Penny that this would easily stretch to a 10 week course.  This would allow for some general background on the different perspectives offered by the authors mentioned in the CD.  With modest modifications, ACCEPT22 Oct 2018 11:24 am: Jim Whitters
Agree with Penny and Frank that this could very easily be a 10 week course which would provide time for developing a historic foundation that will be helpful to the class as they read and discuss the books. Interesting course to be sure. Accept with edits recommended.22 Oct 2018 4:07 pm: Ron Ebert

Great idea for a study group, though I share Barbara's concern about how the SGL will deal with participants who aren't up to speed on either the history or the literature of the Western Front. A 10-week format would allow time to deal with that issue, but perhaps Dan can handle it in the shorter format via mini-lectures, etc. I like Mickey's suggested edits. 23 Oct 2018 12:03 pm: Katherine O'Connor
This sounds great, and the title is wonderful.

Obviously, an important issue. I'm not familiar with either book, but the blurbs suggest that they are both authoritative and quite good. The CD is clear and points to important issues for what should be rich discussion, assuming that the SGL is adept at handling what will be lively discussion.

In lectures and discussion, this study group will analyze its transformation from the ashes of World War I into a different, modern Middle East. The dissolution of the Ottoman Empire after the prolonged war on the Eastern fronts established the seeds of the area's discontent. Our class will study the fast-moving events in which the Ottoman Empire simultaneously took on Russian, British, and French troops; political intrigues topped the agenda of European powers; and diplomatic and intelligence activities were at their peak. The Sykes-Picot Agreement, the Hussein-McMahon Correspondence, the Balfour Declaration, the Cairo Conference all attempted to establish a ""Peace to End All Peace.""

Seems like a great topic, and if there was a waitlist for the previous offering, I assume that there is interest. I assume that someone will check on how the previous offering was received. The CD provides a nice orientation to the core issue, but it could use some word-smithing. Obviously needs to be a single paragraph. Perhaps some explicit mention of discussion format? A suggested rewrite for the final sentence: ""The Sykes-Picot Agreement, Hussein-McMahon Correspondence, Balfour Declaration, and Cairo Conference, among others. established what was termed by XXXX to be a ""Peace to End All Peace."" However, in reality these agreements established a set of unsustainable governance systems imposed by the European Powers, based on incomprehensible and unacceptable principles in the eyes of the local populations.""20 Oct 2018 9:56 am: Barbara Burr
A fine topic.  I think the rewrite Addison suggested for the last two sentences is a big help.  Some of the syntax is a bit rough or vague (eg ""collateral elements"") and could be simplified.  Tense: ""has established"" vs ""established""? Peace to end all Peace needs period outside quotation marks.  Lastly, a comment about lecture vs discussion would be useful...20 Oct 2018 10:53 am: David Bliss
Here is a bit from his previous course on this subject: ""it was the fronts in the Middle East that gave rise to fast-moving events and unpredictable outcomes..."" and "" Our class will study these fluid , changing tides where the Ottoman empire simultaneously took on Russian, British, and French troops; where political intrigues topped the agenda of European powers: and where diplomatic and intelligence activities were at their peak."" The catalog says it was a ten-week course starting in week 1.20 Oct 2018 11:33 am: Helen Bakeman
This will be a wonderful class.  I have only taken one of George’s classes and it was excellent but mostly lecture. In addition to Addison’s suggestions...first sentence, take Middle East out of quotes; I think that the verb should be “was” rather than “has been”. Second sentence—small “m’ for modern. For the guts of the CD, edit to make clearer and borrow from old proposal that David cites if that helps.20 Oct 2018 2:13 pm: Mickey Zemon
I agree with all comments made above. 
Sentence 2:  I think World War I should be spelled out - not WWI
Sentence 3:  can just say war rather than WWI since it is mentioned in previous sentence; delete has between front and established
Other required materials: delete what is there and put what is in Other preparation in Other required materials. Replace semi-colon with comma after Picot Agreement; replace available on the Web-site with posted on the course website.
Bio: need to indicate  that he earned a medical degree before he taught Cardiology
Additional scheduling info:  I thought that a delayed opening always meant the class started two sessions after the 12 week classes.  It sounds like George wants to start a week later and end a week earlier.  Can we accommodate this?
20 Oct 2018 4:24 pm: Frank Speizer

Better. The last sentence is a doozy, even with commas instead of semi-colons. I suggest deleting ""imposed by the European Powers modernizing the Middle East."" This thought is contained in the preceding sentence, and without it the sentence is easier to digest. 
Not sure why, but the first sentence now doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the CD. What about a different lead-in, one that highlights the many current sociopolitical tensions among and within the Middle Eastern countries? 22 Oct 2018 7:50 pm: Linda Neumann
Much better
Agree with Addison that the first sentence seems disconnected.  Does he want to imply that the disastrous political consequences of WWI in the Middle East are responsible for its no longer being the leader in science and innovation?

"Hemingway: A Farewell to Arms","Mistake","Susan Harris","","","0","Spring 2019","Second Half","","Literature","Ernest Hemingway’s “A Farewell to Arms” was published in 1929.  The novel was immediately banned in Boston by the Boston police.  It is both a war story and a love story.  It involves an American, Frederick Henry and his experience in the Italian Army during World War 1.  Henry is wounded, and is brought back to health by a nurse ( Catherine Barkley) in a Milan hospital.  The two fall in love, and the novel traces the story of their ill-fated romance.  “A Farewell to Arms” is arguably Hemingway’s finest book.  It features his best writing: his most famous passages are contained in the book.  If “The Sun Also Rises” was the novel that made Hemingway famous, “A Farewell to Arms” made him wealthy.

We will conduct a slow reading of the novel.  We will also read a handful of Hemingway short stories that may bear light on the development of “A Farewell to Arms.”","2","","John","","Clarke","","clarkekelsos@aol.com","5189516371","0","","","","","","","","","","Ernest Hemingway|A Farewell to Arms|Scribners|2012|A Farewell to Arms, the Hemingway Library Edition","","","","","<strong>Readings: </strong>This edition only: Ernest Hemingway, <em>A Farewell to Arms</em>&nbsp;(Scribners, 2012).","Estimated outside work is two hours per week.

This CD needs to be fleshed out.  The description of the plot can be condensed to one sentence "" the novel traces the story of the ill-fated romance between......"" without all the details of names and falling in love.  Why is this arguably Heminway's best novel?  Themes?  Structure? Maybe add a short comment on status of Heminway's career in 1929.
Change ""slow reading"" to ""detailed reading"" or something better.
Last sentence - what is a handful of short stories?  Change ""may"" to ""will bear light""""?17 Oct 2018 8:38 am: Addison Stone
Agree with Linda's suggested edits and questions. We need to know less about the plot and more about the qualities of the writing that make the book H's best. Also, the issue of the Boston banning of the book needs either to be fleshed out a bit (reason for ban; link to its broader reception?) or eliminated from the CD. Note that CD needs to be a signle paragraph, and that the specification of the edition of the book should be moved into the title field. 17 Oct 2018 10:52 am: Katherine O'Connor
The CD is too descriptive of the book and has absolutely no edge to it. For what it's worth, many would say that For Whom the Bell Tolls is his best book. If one knew anything at all about Hemingway, this would hardly draw you in.17 Oct 2018 11:02 am: Ron Ebert
Very static writing- i agree with Katherine that cd has no edge. Less plot and more about why this book is significant, and why it made him wealthy.17 Oct 2018 11:51 am: Sara Freedman
Agree with above critiques: no edge to CD, needs less plot and more about qualities of the book that make it so ""Hemenway"" and important as a literary phenomenon. Why does he feel it is such a great novel? How does it compare with his other work? Not clear why banned in Boston is included. Could shed light on choice of book if explained.17 Oct 2018 11:51 am: Sara Freedman

I concur with Ron-------in re-writing the CD focus upon why this book is significant as well as its impact upon Hemingway in terms of wealth and/or reputation and the SGL will offer a CD that does have ""edge."" Should be an interesting course.17 Oct 2018 12:46 pm: Barbara Burr
Most of us have probably read this novel, so it will be important to know why we might like to reread it at this point!17 Oct 2018 2:01 pm: Mickey Zemon
Agree with above comments.  In addition to making it one paragraph, the quotations around titles need to be replaced with italics.
In sentence starting with Henry is wounded --delete the comma after wounded and eliminate the name of the nurse in parentheses.
Next to last sentence -- replace the colon with an and
Delete the sentence on conducting  a slow reading -- it is not about how slowly we read it but about how well we comprehend it
Other required materials:  Will these be provided on the course website? State how many -- delete a handful.  If he can link to them on the internet great, if not may be copyright issues in printing out several different short stories.
Bio: he forgot to put the first letter of his first name in upper case

The second installment of the serialized book was banned by police chief Michael J. Crowley in 1929 on the grounds it was ""salacious"", thereby banning the sale of Scribner's Magazine at newsstands.   This greatly stimulated the sales of the book when it appeared later that year. Perhaps the CD could contain the question of why was the book was banned?  If there are notable quotes that make this the ""finest"" work, could he include a short line or two? 18 Oct 2018 2:20 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with much of above. SGL is a newbee and may just need some general advice.  Needs less plot description and more reasons for interest.  SGL clearly has some international experience with discussion of the book and ought to be able to raise some questions comparing reception of the work.  I think the word we use for a careful read is ""close read"".  Course should be attractive. 18 Oct 2018 10:34 pm: Penny Revelle
I agree with the above comments asking for less plot description and more about why this is an important book.
The short stories should be mentioned or a book containing them should be part of the assigned reading.
nit-picking:  In the second sentence ""The book was immediately banned by the police in Boston. ""  Don't need to say Boston twice - I doubt if any other police department would get away with banning a book in Boston.
I think. the common usage is ""shed light"", not ""bear light"".","false","","139","2018-10-16 21:44:49","https://ccsubmit.com/","","","","","","Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; CPU OS 11_4_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/11.0 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1","216.19.246.179","","complete","complete","","","rejected","","pending","","","","","cancelled","","1540143694"

I like this proposal, but it seems like a bit too much is packed into the 6 weeks. Four of those 6 sessions seem largely devoted to watching the two productions. In addition to reading the plays in advance of the watching sessions, there are also ""articles and book excerpts"" to read and discuss. How will this all fit in?17 Oct 2018 10:56 am: Katherine O'Connor
Great idea for a course. Accept with suggested edits. ""Worked in the New York theater"" is very vague. Couldn't the bio be a bit more specific?17 Oct 2018 11:31 am: Sara Freedman
The first two sentences give wonderful atmosphere but could be removed to make sure CD fits 150 word limit. Would like some greater sense of what issues/questions are central to his work and would be discussed in class and why he is now considered to be among the greatest of American playwrights and in some sense a breakthrough artist of the American stage, one who introduced techniques and topics to the modern theater. Am also concerned with amount of time devoted to watching the plays, as Long Day's is really long. Will there be adequate time for a substantive discussion of the issues, themes, and innovations he introduced?17 Oct 2018 12:42 pm: Barbara Burr
Excellent proposal.  A bit too long. Could leave out the actors’ names. Could also omit “by the tester going public.” Maybe the third sentence should read IT sparked...18 Oct 2018 2:32 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree too long.  Thought first and last sentence could come out ( although I really like the first sentence).  Devoting 4 of the 6 classes to watching the plays seems a bit much.  In fact I wonder about how discussion of the plays would follow having read the play 2 plus weeks before.  What about considering this a 10 week course in which discussion and videos could go at a more leisurely pace.  18 Oct 2018 4:47 pm: David Bliss
A very good addition to the curriculum.  But the CD is a bit too long. If you lose the second sentence it will be within the limit of 150.18 Oct 2018 10:24 pm: Penny Revelle
Well, if you takeout the last sentence, which belongs in ""other required materials,"" anyway, and delete a word or two somewhere, the CD will come within the word limit.
I agree there is a lot of material here, and if she doesn't want to ask for the plays to be read at home and then discussed in class, she should be encouraged to do a ten week course.19 Oct 2018 11:52 pm: Linda Neumann
Could be a very good course, but with the play reading in class and videos, the 10 week course idea is good.  21 Oct 2018 6:25 pm: Jim Whitters

What shaped its history before Columbus, during the colonial period of slavery and beyond, up until the 20th century domination of the United States and global economics? Using a multi-disciplinary combination of published analysis, documentary film, music, and literature, this course will be a discussion-based exploration of the economic, political and social forces that have shaped the many fragmented island nations of the English- and French-Speaking Caribbean, a region that is fragmented in many respects that go far beyond geography. People of West Indian origin represent nearly 4% of the US population. Working alone or in pairs, you will adopt a notable West Indian – dictator, revolutionary, Nobel Laureate, Rastafarian musician – and make a brief presentation to the class.

The CD needs a lot of work.  Title—too much;  needs to be simplified to some version of The History and Culture of the West Indies.  The West Indies includes about 20 countries, with varying histories (think Cuba, Haiti, Turks and Caicos, Puerto Rico). It is worth asking how they will do the history....general and point out outliers, focus on larger countries? And how will the class presentations fit in? The first sentence is good but second sentence needs to make a clearer transition from a random country in the Caribbean to the West Indies more generally. End of second sentence needs to be clearer...domination BY the US and not OF but not DOMINATION of global economics. Third sentence mentions English and French-speaking Caribbean but does not mention Spanish-speaking so maybe it is not the whole West Indies??? Third sentence probably needs to be 2 sentences and use “fragmented” one time less.  The sentence on 4% of US population being West Indian doesn’t really fit;  also delete last sentence. Sentence on presentations needs to be clearer re: purpose. Book—it is a novel about post-colonial Jamaica so it will not set themes for much of the course. Other Required Materials—put in the usual. SGL 1–delete first phrase of first sentence; punctuation. SGL 2–maybe delete academic credentials16 Oct 2018 11:28 pm: Linda Neumann
Like the idea of a course on our neighbors (and some fellow citizens).  
Agree with Helen's analyses.  Title sounds like a travelogue.  Some sentences need repair and some should be delleted (4%, last sentence).  
The West Indies encompasses English, Spanish, French and Dutch former colonies.  Although they all endured colonial rule, slavery, and chaos, their histories and cultural development must have been very different.  Difficult to see how to focus on diverse histories, especially without a text.  
Don't see why presentations should be restricted to notable persons - could be historic episodes or other topics.17 Oct 2018 7:57 am: Susan Harris
This is an interesting idea from two SGLs who are uniquely qualified to lead a course on the Caribbean area.  But the proposal needs much more focus.  In particular, the objective of studying ""what shaped the history of [the region]"" is very broad and not well aligned with the materials to be studied.  The Rhys book is a novel set in Jamaica, the film to be shown is about IMF policies as they affect developing nations with Jamaica as its focus.  Other countries will presumably be studied with materials that the SGLs are still selecting.  One approach would be to narrow the focus of the course (geographically, to certain periods in history, or to literature rather than history).  A second approach would be to keep the focus broad but to find a book that discusses the whole region and it's history.  17 Oct 2018 8:17 am: Addison Stone
I agree that this general topic is a good one, but that the current plan and CD are much too diffuse. Above suggestions for possible reining in of the topic are all good. SGLs need this feedback and encouragement to tighten the focus.17 Oct 2018 10:42 am: Ron Ebert
Clearly the right people to offer a course on the carribean- with more focus and edits as above should be a good offer. Choice of book should be discussed- does it truly raise the issues they eant to discuss?17 Oct 2018 11:03 am: Katherine O'Connor
The multi-disciplinary approach to the topic could be refreshing but agree that the CD needs to be clarified and made more focused. I was perplexed by the use of the verbal metaphor ""adopt.""    17 Oct 2018 12:16 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree that the course proposal is too diffuse in focus: history, culture, literature, economics, impact of tourism and development etc...are too much.  I like the interdisciplinary approach, but perhaps a few islands of the leaders’ choosing should be used as  ore in depth case studies? Don’t like the somewhat condescending title; some of us Lived/worked in the West Inies or have read fiction by West Indian writers etc. I have spoken with Anita and I know her heart is really in this!17 Oct 2018 9:31 pm: Mickey Zemon
I agree the first thing to be done is to narrow the focus of the course.  As Susan and others suggest, there are many ways to do this.  And how they do this will affect the title as well -- but that Not Advertised in Tourist Brochures could certainly be dropped!  
They need a text, not a work of fiction, to provide background for the class members.  Fine to keep Wide Sargasso Sea as well -- it is a 10 week course.
Look forward to seeing a second draft that clearly describes the content and scope of the class. Giving people brief presentations to make should not be used as a substitute for planning thoughtful class discussions.18 Oct 2018 2:44 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree as written unfocused.  Had trouble reading the compound sentences where the first parts don't seem to fit the second parts.  Topic a good one and right people to do it.

"The Innovative Stories of Katherine Mansfield","Approved","Linda Neumann","","","0","Spring 2019","Second Half","","Literature","Katherine Mansfield was an unlikely person to emerge as a master innovator of the modern short story. An immigrant to England from colonial New Zealand and at odds with her affluent bourgeois family, she was impacted by major illness, the effects of the First World War, a restless, peripatetic lifestyle, and a fraught, conflicted love life. Yet she harnessed her powers to write short stories characterized by luminous detail and subtle nuances of tone that resist simple, definitive interpretation. As Mansfield maintained in a letter to Virginia Woolf, one of her fervent admirers, “‘What the writer does is not so much to <em>solve </em>the question but to <em>put</em> the question.’” Our focus will be on the close reading of several of her provocative, inventive stories. The class website will provide material on Mansfield’s biography and critical reception and excerpts from her copious letters and notebooks.","2","","Sharon","","Hamilton","","sharonh.580@gmail.com","781-777-2444","3 or more","","","","","","","","","","Katherine Mansfield|Katherine Mansfield: Selected Stories|Oxford UP|2002 (reissued 2008)|X","","","","","<strong>Readings: </strong>This edition only: Katherine Mansfield, <em>Katherine Mansfield: Selected Stories</em>&nbsp;(Oxford University Press, 2002 (reissued 2008)).","Estimated outside work is two hours per week.

"Alice Munro’s Short Stories: Exploring the Genre","Approved","Helen Bakeman","","","0","Spring 2019","Either First or Second Half","","Literature","Recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016, Alice Munro is recognized worldwide for her exploration of and experimentation with short story as a genre. Her stories can be challenging to understand because they draw on intricate connections of memories and experiences, past and present, often forming a kind of kaleidoscope. In this study group, we will seek to gain insights into the impact of her stories by analyzing and discussing distinctive characteristics of three types of short stories she writes. One category is autobiographical “stories,” narratives drawn from her life—what Munro calls “not quite stories.” Another is the first-person narrative with fictional components. The third type consists of longer and more complex stories—what she calls “odder stories that branch out a lot.” Group members will read two or three stories for each meeting; additional resources include reviews and interviews with Munro.","3","","Joanne","","Carlisle","","jfcarl@umich.edu","7343551182","3 or more","","","","","","","","","","Alice Munro|Family Furnishings|Vintage|2014|x","","","","","<strong>Readings: </strong>This edition only: Alice Munro, <em>Family Furnishings</em>&nbsp;(Vintage, 2014).","Estimated outside work is three hours per week.

Munro is a great topic. The CD needs some work: You don't need ""to understand"" after ""challenging""; ""structure and impact"" is vague.  In  her discussion of the four types of stories, she seems to  go from type #1 to type #3. The writing needs to be tightened up and made more focused. I was her Sponsor for an earlier proposal, and she resisted rewriting to any considerable degree.16 Oct 2018 12:08 pm: Susan Harris
Good topic. I find the style a little stiff but overall the CD does a good job of explaining the course. I was able to follow the four types of stories but agree that this part could be tightened up.16 Oct 2018 1:20 pm: David Bliss
This is a great topic and a great SGL.  The sentence ""One is autobiographical “stories,” narratives...""  could be written:
""One is autobiographical “story” narratives drawn from her life"".  She needs to shorten the Bio.16 Oct 2018 1:53 pm: Addison Stone
I'll stay away from this one, but I do want everyone to know that Joanne is my wife.
Addison16 Oct 2018 2:23 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree sentence on One is autobiographical ... a little awkward but I was able to follow the 4 types easily.  In Bio second sentence is a a little confusing.  It is not clear what her job was, as there clearly seems to have been a job since she retired subsequently.  ACCEPT 16 Oct 2018 2:38 pm: Sara Freedman
Four distinctive types of stories could be more clearly delineated. The first person narrative is the second type. ""These will be compared to the second type, first person narratives with fictional components."" Sounds like sound  SG with experienced SGL.16 Oct 2018 3:52 pm: Ron Ebert
I too find the typology confusing. Perhaps just leave out the “one ” and “third type” and let reader draw inferences. Thus, “Autobiographical stories are narratives...16 Oct 2018 5:54 pm: Mickey Zemon

I like Mickey's idea of taking out the ""four"" in story types and just saying ---""stories that represent distinctly different types.""  I think that would make the remaining descriptions less confusing  because the reader won't  be trying to count and keep track of the types.

A very interesting subject, but the CD is oddly worded.  What exactly has exploded?  Does this mean proliferation of data, or exploding the quantity of data?  I recommend starting with a question like: ""How can we retain the security and economic benefits of the internet without sacrificing our privacy, liberty, and civic values?""  Or ""Should social media be regulated?"" There needs to be some tension in the course description.  As it stands, it sounds too technocratic.  Also since the Farivar book is only used once, and it is a bit pricey ($42 0n ebay) could they consider dropping its requirement, and provide  scanned passages of the appropriate section?15 Oct 2018 7:59 pm: Penny Revelle
[Workflow note] The Farivir book is only on $18 on Amazon, so I don't think that is a problem- Penny15 Oct 2018 9:50 pm: Sara Freedman
Important subject with wide appeal and it is wonderful that they include a week by week list of readings and topics.  CD needs some work although it doesn't sound too technocratic to me but a better idea of the main issues would help give people a sense of the kinds of issues that will be discussed. David's ideas of starting with questions is a good one and could solve the problem of lack of clarity of what the course will focus on. 
Using quotes from a book not yet introduced is problematic, better to simply state the main foci of the course without using the quotes. Grammatical questions: Is data singular or plural? If the quote is used, then the ""this"" in ""we look at this closely"" needs to be defined or changed to ""these issues"" since the quote includes 
""scope and implications"" as the antecedents. ""Lite"" needs to be changed to ""light."" Period needs to be added after ""events."" 15 Oct 2018 10:02 pm: Mickey Zemon
First sentence: change to --Our world, rich and poor, IS now online and data is all over. Maybe delete rich and poor?
Second sentence: need to define exploded data before using it.  Place an AND between health and improvements and a period after areas; delete , but there are also caveats. 
Express some of these sentences as questions, for example: What is the scope and implications of the revolution in data generation, collection, and analytics?  How do we  retain the security and economic benefits of these developments without sacrificing our privacy, liberty, and civic values?  Since they are using Chertoff's book, I think they can borrow a few of his words from it without citing him in the CD.
Fifth sentence from last: change lite to light; add an ''a'' between with and focus
Fourth and third sentence from last: change to -- Participants will also be responsible for researching pertinent current events  ABOUT DATA COLLECTION ISSUES, and these assignments will be the basis of our weekly discussions.  I think this is what she is saying here.
Title: first book has a dot above first letter of title; second book -- is there a typo there? What is  dhabeas data?
Bios: need a trim
Last two sentences: delete -- prep time shows up in Workload15 Oct 2018 10:06 pm: Barbara Burr
Good topic but not so well written. First sentence defeats me. Does data actually explode, or is it the quantity of data that explodes? Last two sentences not necessary and third to last is unclear - do assignments refer to the reading, the researching of current events or both?  Is “lite” an ok adjective in this context?15 Oct 2018 10:38 pm: Jim Whitters
This should be an interesting course with broad appeal. I concur with the comments above that suggest that the CD should be harnessed---the first two sentences are confusing but the third sentence begins to get at the essence of the course. The last two sentences can be eliminated altogether.16 Oct 2018 8:08 am: Susan Harris
Great idea, writing needs improvement as mentioned above.  Data is a plural noun but so many publications are allowing the singular usage now (e.g. NY Times) that I guess I can swallow my distaste for it if I have to.16 Oct 2018 8:49 am: Addison Stone
Agree that this is a great topic for a study group. Also agree that the wording of the CD needs tweaking. Like Linda, I cringe when 'data' is used as a singular noun. The ""explosion"" is presumably both the quantity of information about any given topic AND the range of topics about which data are being collected/disseminated. Might be good to clarify. The bit about SGMs researching current issues definitely needs clarification. What will they be looking for? Other suggestions for rewording and deletions seem good to me, and I won't add to the mix. I like the inclusion of a goal for each session. We might consider encouraging something like that. It makes you think concretely about what you want to accomplish, and the exercise might result in clearer CDs.16 Oct 2018 10:46 am: Helen Bakeman
Agree that this is an interesting and timely topic but CD needs lots of rewriting.  there are stray characters at start of both book titles.  Other Required—use standard language. Bios—trimming (take out  employers for both SGLs for a start)16 Oct 2018 11:29 am: Katherine O'Connor
Agree that CD needs some work, but this is a wonderful and timely topic. I think data can ""explode""! I agree with David's comment about some desirable ""tension"" needed in the CD. Admit that the CD sounds a bit technocratic, but Jean, I'm sure, will not be in class. 16 Oct 2018 2:37 pm: Frank Speizer
Data ARE always Plural!  So much for the NYtimes.  Topic is a good one,  but CD should be redrafted. My trouble with the CD was trying to figure out whose data are at risk.  Clearly there are public data bases, but is the concern about ones own data?  I think that is the question, and I agree with David that some more grabbing intro is needed.   Some statement on class format is necessary.  (My past experience with these two SGLs was that they were super prepared, but that led to little time for discussion, and no time for topic not planned to be explored. 16 Oct 2018 3:41 pm: Ron Ebert
I think the data exploding resulted in the stray characters in the book titles! Rewriting as suggested by most is necessary. I agree that the current events should be spelled out as in “ for example...”. Certainly fine topic.17 Oct 2018 12:13 am: Linda Neumann
Seems that the central topics are in the sentences containing the quotes.  Agree that they should remove the quotes  while getting those ideas across.  The sentences containing ""exploding data"" need to be rewritten and type of explosion clarified.  Last two sentences unnecessary.  Assignments as basis for discussion not clear.  Aren't the book readings the basis?
The appended syllabus seems clear and interesting.  Need to fix the CD.18 Oct 2018 8:57 pm: Penny Revelle

Excellent proposal. Last sentence not necessary so word count can be reduced. CD might mention intention for class to be mainly discussion.15 Oct 2018 8:08 am: Addison Stone
I like the idea for this SG, but the CD needs a bit of tinkering. It's a bit too long but also a bit rambling, so cutting it should involve loss of info. I suggest recasting the last two sentences into something like: ""Through discussion based on questions distributed prior to each class, we will explore the history of the colony, the introduction of slavery, and the relationship between slavery and the founding of the Republic. Additional sources, including podcasts and portions of other books, will be used to provide a fuller picture of this history.""15 Oct 2018 9:52 am: Helen Bakeman
The CD is not sexy but does a nice job of setting up the premise and content of the course.  I suggest leaving it largely as it is, delete last sentence of the CD and add a short sentence that it will be discussion-based. Other required materials—do the usual sentence about other materials on course website and the Seeing White podcast. Maybe delete her European history graduate study .15 Oct 2018 10:36 am: David Bliss
Nice idea for a study group.  Could drop the name of the book from the CD.  Perhaps say ""we will read and discuss an acclaimed work on Slavery by Edmund Morgan...""

Clear CD and good topic.  Agree with edits mentioned above.  Accept15 Oct 2018 5:54 pm: Mickey Zemon
A very impressive CD.  
Deleting the last sentence would trim CD to close to 150 words.  Much of the info in that sentence is repeated under Other required materials.  
To indicate that this will be a discussion-based class,  she could start what is now the next to the last sentence with Our class discussions will be largely based on . . .
In the Other required materials, she needs to decide what additional sources she is going to use or just say excerpts from additional sources will be provided.  And how is she going to use them?  Pages from? Chapters from?  Books left in Dunlop Library for people to use? The class cannot possibly read two additional books to the one required.  15 Oct 2018 8:12 pm: Penny Revelle
This looks like a really interesting course, especially for history buffs.
I agree that the last two sentences could be deleted (the book is already mentioned in the book section and the other materials mentioned go in the ""other required materials section"").  Instead add a sentence, as Helen and Mickey suggest, on how she will conduct the course - discussion I assume.
I would hope the TLC would steer her away from assigning much of the two more books mentioned in a 6 week course.15 Oct 2018 9:55 pm: Sara Freedman

The course will describe the role of astronomical influences in shaping many aspects of everyday life, such as calendars, time measurement, and navigation. It is particularly intended for individuals with little or no formal math or science background, and will exemplify the power of very basic physical concepts to explain the workings of the universe. Questions and requests for clarifications will be encouraged. We will explore four separate topic areas: our solar system and the universe beyond; the astronomy “toolbox” of special units of measure, vocabulary, and mapping the sky; astronomical phenomena, including the continually changing night sky, meteor showers, moon phases and eclipses; and human understanding and application of astronomically-based tools such as calendars, time-keeping, tides and celestial navigation.","1","","John","","Hopkins","","j.hopkins@verizon.net","6174918369","3 or more","","","","","","","","","","Marcia Bartusiak|Archives of the Universe|Vintage Books|2006|","Ron Miller, William Hartmann|The Grand Tour, A Traveler's Guide to the Solar System, 3rd ed.|Workman Publishing|2005|x","","","","<strong>Readings: </strong>Marcia Bartusiak, <em>Archives of the Universe</em>&nbsp;(Vintage Books, 2006); This edition only: Ron Miller, William Hartmann, <em>The Grand Tour, A Traveler's Guide to the Solar System, 3rd ed.</em>&nbsp;(Workman Publishing, 2005).","Estimated outside work is one hour per week.

I am confused by the sentence ""Most sessions will address four separate topic areas: (1) our Solar System and the universe beyond; (2) the astronomy “toolbox” of special units of measure, vocabulary, mapping the sky, etc; (3) astronomical phenomena (e.g. the continually changing night sky, meteor showers, moon phases, eclipses; and (4) human inventions: eg. tides, calendars, and seasons.""
Doe the mean that every session will deal with all 4 topics?  Or as I suppose, that all four topics will show up in one session or another?  Could maybe say ""We will explore four separate topic areas ---""- and then list them with commas instead of colon and semicolons and get rid of the numbers.
Also, is one hour prep per week reasonable?  There are 2 books, and online videos are mentioned.14 Oct 2018 7:59 pm: Mickey Zemon
Looks like a great course.  
Next to last sentence:
(1)  -- should the S's in solar system be in upper case?
(2) -- delete etc and put an and before mapping
(3)  -- delete the parentheses and add including after phenomena and an and before eclipses
(4) --  delete colon followed by eg. and replace with such as
Last sentence: delete
Workload: it would certainly take me more than an hour a week to do the preparation for this course
14 Oct 2018 8:01 pm: Ron Ebert
I too am confused by the four topics, but if, as i suspect, this is  his structure for the course it would be much clearer if he he dropped the “most sessions...” and substituted “We will focus on four areas of inquiry...” I like idea of astronomy “for dummies” and i imagine it will be popular. If he taught this twice previously is this the same cd?15 Oct 2018 7:59 am: Addison Stone
Agree that this is a good offering. Also agree that the edits suggested above will help. It also seems that the CD should mention the class format. Can SGL put in the comment re format that is included in Further Info (""presentations with images and outlines via PowerPoint"")? I also agree that 2 hours of prep might be more realistic.15 Oct 2018 10:24 am: David Bliss
Not to nit-pick, but tides are not a human invention.  Tide charts, maybe? The Hartmann ( spelled with a t ) book is really a big picture book, and probably does not require intense study, so maybe one hour per week is OK.
15 Oct 2018 4:42 pm: Frank Speizer
Since he has taught this twice before do we have evaluations?  I am of two minds. If prep time is only an hour/week is this really a 12 week Course., particularly if one of the books is a picture book?  On the other hand in understanding the workings of gravity both in terms of concepts and by formula is this a more intense lecture course and he does need 12 weeks.  He needs to indicate how much lecture vs discussion.   All said, if this has worked in the past than offering again seems ok. 15 Oct 2018 10:00 pm: Sara Freedman
I love the idea of a course on this topic, particularly one that is open to non scientists but will present the important concepts in in-depth ways that can be grasped by those without a technical background in the subject. 

Agree with Penny's comments about structure of each class. He implies that the four areas will be included in each class, this needs to be clarified. Also, workload would probably more than one hour a week for people not familiar with the material. 16 Oct 2018 8:26 am: Susan Harris
I agree the ""four areas"" sentence is confusing and like Ron's approach to fixing it.   The course format should be clearer.  I agree with Mickey's edits and don't think ""solar system"" should be capitalized.16 Oct 2018 11:36 am: Katherine O'Connor
I too agree that Ron's suggestion re the ""four areas of inquiry"" clears of the confusion resulting from the current phrasing. This course really does sound like an introductory course, that is, a first step toward a deeper exploration of many intriguing topics. I took a black holes class that I found very interesting if largely incomprehensible. I would have been wiser to start out more modestly. Accept with minor edits.edit16 Oct 2018 11:07 pm: Linda Neumann
The four areas of inquiry should be cleared up.  It seems that he would cover the first two and then get to the next ones.  One hour of preparation seems too little - even for a very elementary course.  There is some value in having the SGMs sweat a little in the preparations before his lectures.
Tide are not human inventions and I would say that seasons are not either.
I would hope that he would indicate the basic mysteries that remain in our understanding of the universe and not leave the impression that all is explained by "" the power of very basic physical concepts to explain the workings of the universe.""

[Workflow note] The 5th sentence in the CD has been re-written in accordance with the recommended edits. Solar System is now ""solar system."" Under Further Information, the 3rd sentence has been slightly altered in accordance with a recommended edit. I talked with the SGL about 1 hour preparation and he believes, based upon his experience with the earlier course that 1 hour is correct so I have left it in place.22 Oct 2018 6:13 pm: Mickey Zemon
I think he needs a colon between areas and our solar system in the sentence that starts with We will explore four separate topic areas, ... also it would be better to use a semi-colon to separate the clauses since they contain commas within them.

Very enticing subject for a study group.  The CD needs to be a single paragraph.  The 1982 version of the Newhall book is pricey at $49.  There is a 1978 version for under $5.  Would the older version be acceptable?  (The original version was written in 1939)13 Oct 2018 6:56 pm: Ron Ebert
Cd needs work. Leave out first session..Perhaps  , We will begin by examining.... Also substitute commas for semi colins. Remove schools from bio14 Oct 2018 9:31 am: Barbara Burr
A wonderful topic, but could be rewritten to be a bit more clear and leave out certain details which will not be familiar to most people (?calotype).  Suffice it to say that the history of the photographic process will be discussed, including the limitations of the each process, the types of cameras used etc...Also, I think the number of ""topics"" feels too overwhelming for 6wks.  (Could spend 6 wks on ""Pictorialism and Naturalism""  alone.) Easily a 10 or 12 wk class especially if you throw in a visit or two to the Harvard Art Museum.14 Oct 2018 10:03 am: Addison Stone
Agree that this is a good topic, presented by a knowledgeable SGL. The last sentence of the CD should be integrated with the paragraph, with parens removed. I'm okay with the content of the CD otherwise but agree with Ron that the details re first session are not necessary. Two minor edits: in first sentence, need comma after ""century""; in second sentence, ""but applications..."" should be ""but also for applications....""
Re cost of Newhall book, I see lots of used copies in Good or Very Good condition on Amazon for very reasonable prices.14 Oct 2018 10:48 am: Penny Revelle
This looks like a good course but I would expect all those topics to take 12 weeks rather than 6.
In line 4 needs a few words --prior to ""the invention of"" photography --
And, of course, the last parentheses needs to be incorporated into the body of the CD.14 Oct 2018 11:18 am: Mickey Zemon
I agree with the edits suggested above.   The topic certainly lends itself to a 12 week class, and hopefully Robinson can be persuaded  to expand it to a full semester course.  It is a very interesting idea for a study group, and the proposer is very well qualified to lead it.14 Oct 2018 6:17 pm: Frank Speizer
One suspects that this new SGL is going with 6 weeks to get her feet wet.  If so, so be it and I would not push too hard. On the other hand she could easily fill 10 or 12 and might just be nudged in that direction, particularly with a second visit to either Fogg or Carpenter Center, both of which have excellent collections.

I agree with Sara. And it is great to see a fall 20018 new member volunteering to lead a study group her second semester at HILR. 
Third sentence: If the ''South'' does exist.  What exactly does she mean by that? The South as a literary concept? I would like clarification.

Sounds like a great course and a knowledgeable SGL. I wish there were room in the CD to mention some of the authors to be included, but given the historical scope, that seems unrealistic. Note that the book (a Norton anthology) is 1200 pages long! Hopefully, the SGL will be realistic about reading assignments. Is the 2-hour load realistic? Perhaps someone should clarify her expectations re pages/week. Otherwise, I say Go.13 Oct 2018 5:42 pm: Ron Ebert
Beginning a bit repetitive- perhaps eliminate the sentence “if the south does exist”. Otherwise a good cd and interesting topic13 Oct 2018 9:12 pm: Linda Neumann
She could leave out "" (short stories, documentaries, poetry and essays) "" in last sentence as she has mentioned various genres previously and could leave out the 2nd sentence.  That would free up some space to mention some of the authors.  But I would understand if she prefers not to.

Since I more or less helped Stephen come up with this course, I think it has merit.  Stephen is a terrific travel blogger and his own writing in this genre has a lot to offer. The CD should be more formally written, which could easily be done by including the bullets into a coherent paragraph. I suggest he include a number of well known travel writers whose work they could examine as examples at the beginning of the course. Otherwise, course follows format of previous writing course I took with Bob Kinerk, which was highly successful.13 Oct 2018 3:07 pm: Sara Freedman
I would also make his bio less self-deprecating and include the fact that he writes a travel blog.13 Oct 2018 3:16 pm: Mickey Zemon
The CD is too short.  And he needs to combine what he has above into one paragraph.  He mentions Reading and discussing excerpts from the works of travel writers.  Suggest he mention a few of these writers and what distinguishes them from others who write in this genre.
There are many good books about travel writing, and he should assign one of them and not just rely on handouts.
A little more information about how many guest speakers and how much class time they will take up would be good -- and who might these guest speakers be?
A very appealing proposal -- all of us like to travel and share the interesting things that happen along the way.
13 Oct 2018 6:42 pm: Ron Ebert
Seems like a travel memoir class. In addition to rewriting cd by making sentences out of the bullets, and putting into one paragraph, he definitely should add his blog in bio and add “of” before books. T and l should assist him to think through how to structure his course. 13 Oct 2018 9:25 pm: Linda Neumann
Agree with Mickey that he should mention some of the travel writers, if he would not use a book.  Also would be interesting to hear what are the challenges or what characterizes writing travel memoirs.  Obviously he needs to get rid of the bullets.  Bio could be more enticing.14 Oct 2018 9:18 am: Barbara Burr
Agree with all the above thoughts.  I would like to see some reading from wonderful travel books (On the Road comes to mind among many others) as inspirations for the class, not just ""how to.""  14 Oct 2018 11:06 am: Jim Whitters
Interesting course. The names and books/essays of the travel writers the SGL intends to use are imperative as the above comments assert.14 Oct 2018 11:09 am: Penny Revelle
Seems like almost all the info is there, just needs to be arranged into the catalogue format.  Agree an assigned book would be a good idea (Helps discussion of every has read the same thing first.) and could be supplemented with excerpts from the SGM's favorite travel writers on the course website.14 Oct 2018 6:04 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with much of the above.  Only issue to consider is how this course would work for someone who has yet to plan a trip.  Might need to indicate how the course would help both the writer, on as well as off and perhaps just planning that trip. Agree it is almost all there and just needs restructuring. 16 Oct 2018 8:51 am: Susan Harris
Yes, obviously put this in the right format as discussed.  I would not insist that the SGL use a book about how to write about travel.  Many successful writing classes here have taken the approach that this SGL does which is to read examples of writing from great writers but not a ""how to write"" text.  I think the plan to read 3 SGM works a week for five weeks is realistic.16 Oct 2018 12:01 pm: Katherine O'Connor
The description is definitely too chatty and informal.  Shouldn't something be said about the different kinds of travel writing (with representative examples) as a kind of introduction to the topic?

The Weininger courses have also been well received and clearly are music appreciation with lots of music history of the composers and the times. I suspect that most of us have been in at least one of their courses.  My only suggestion is CD needs to be shortened by taking out second and last sentence. Both their bios need shortening.  Note as indicated this course given last spring.  Suggest it be repeated on different day to open options for those with restricted days at HILR.  ACCEPT  12 Oct 2018 7:12 pm: Mickey Zemon
I agree with Frank about deleting second and last sentence and trimming the bios.  Also agree about the great value of this course.
Fourth sentence:  change ''Our aims in this course'' to ''Our objectives are to'' -- also delete the etc in this sentence and ''or cannot'' after can
Other required materials:  SGMs will be provided with background material and listening guides for each of the six sessions - how will these be provided?  on course website? a course pack? are these materials accessible through Google? if not, are they going to be scanned?  are they under copyright?  How are they going to distribute ""CDs containing recordings of the compositions'' to all class members?12 Oct 2018 7:40 pm: Penny Revelle
Rather than deleting the second sentence I think I would combine the 1st and 2nd: ""The common image of Beethoven is that of a heroic figure and his most famous pieces, ie the third and fifth symphonies, validate that image.""
Take out the words ""on the part of the SGLs"" in the 5th sentence and delete the last sentence.  That would bring the CD down to 150 words.
Otherwise looks good.12 Oct 2018 8:34 pm: Barbara Burr
Excellent topic for a course, sand should be of wide interest.  I agree with above suggestions and would only add that I found the 3rd sentence a bit odd (""wider variety...of multiple personae""), though I think I know what they mean (that his music has much more depth and nuance than just ""heroic"").  Just needs a little little editing as others suggest.13 Oct 2018 8:26 am: Addison Stone
Agree this would be a good offering. Penny's suggested edits all seem good. Bio's should be shortened (remove Jennifer's UG degree and either eliminate or shorten Stephen's first sentence).13 Oct 2018 9:14 am: Helen Bakeman
Agree with Penny’s edit and deletion suggestions.  Since there is no book, it should be clear that the background materials include biographical information as well as listening guides and background info on music. Bios—delete info on Jennifer’s undergraduate course and first sentence info on Steve. Then accept13 Oct 2018 10:24 am: David Bliss
Sounds like a wonderful music course. The other req'd materials seems to imply that a course pack will be provided.  I assume the members will be asked to pay for that, so why not say it?  13 Oct 2018 11:33 am: Susan Harris
I like Penny's combining of the first and second sentences.  I agree with Barbara that the third sentence is a odd.  It seems meant to provide a contrast with the first two sentences but ""variety of moods"" as a contrast to ""great heroic figure"" doesn't work for me.  ""Multiple personae"" is OK.  I agree the last sentence can go and that bios should be shortened.  Sounds like an excellent course.13 Oct 2018 1:55 pm: Linda Neumann

Wonderful idea for a HILR course. Two SGLs are highly qualified to teach it. CD well organized, clear and informative. Eliminate period after ""critical matter.""12 Oct 2018 6:07 pm: Frank Speizer
Last sentence is confusing.  Is the plan for the SGMs to take the 140 item food frequency questionnaire and actually try to analysis it?  I assume the second half of the sentence should be the SGLs rather than the SGM.  There is room in CD to be more descriptive of the various popular diets that will be considered.  The second sentence really presents two different thoughts that should be separated.  The first half is about diet, the second is about the science and biology of how food changes the gut.  The later should probably come after the next sentence.  I think the SGLs need to rethink whether they want to talk about science of diet, food choice and health.  Trying to bring the two together may be too much as this is really a complex subject for 6 weeks. 12 Oct 2018 6:19 pm: Mickey Zemon
I agree -- great idea for an HILR course, well organized CD, well qualified leaders.
Second sentence:  in the diet -- needs a qualifier -- e.g., the normal diet, the healthy diet, your diet, our diet???
Last sentence:  online dietary analysis for SGM, and through selection of topics and articles by SGM.  Suggest changing this to online dietary analysis for each SGM  as well as through reading and discussion of a selection of relevant articles.  She mentions in this sentence ""selection of a topic"" -- does this mean each member is going to report on a topic?  What it means should be clearly stated in the CD.
Bio: no need to mention that this is first time Brodsky has been an SGL.12 Oct 2018 7:49 pm: Penny Revelle
Well, any course that offers food samples sounds good to me.  But do we have to be careful here not to stray into self-help territory?  I would leave out ""so that more informed decisions can be made about diet."" and put in something more about how the SGM's are going to be involved in the section of topics and articles.
12 Oct 2018 8:22 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree it is a worthwhile and complex topic - it will be important to emphasize this SG is not meant as a nutrition consultation but really to consider the big questions about the science of nutrition as it pertains to aging and the controversies, of which there are many!  12 Oct 2018 11:36 pm: Linda Neumann
This may be a case of trying to encourage too much member participation.  Given that this is a 6 week course and given the experience and expertise of the leaders, it seems that the time would be better spent learning from their scientific and nutritional background.  The online dietary analysis sounds great, but what of members selecting topics and articles?  Are they expected to choose subjects and material for presentations?  Perhaps change ""so that more informed decisions can be made about diet"" to something like ""to better understand the issues and options for healthy nutrition""
Definitely a good topic and could be very good.13 Oct 2018 8:17 am: Addison Stone
Yes, a good topic and well-qualified SGLs, but agree that the emphasis should be a bit more on the science and a bit weaker on the self-help/participation theme. In that spirit, I'd like to see something about the additional readings moved from Other Preparation  to Additional Required Materials, which is actually missing. Need to clarify what role SGMs would play in choosing topics/articles (final sentence). How practical is that in a 6-week SG? Might be better if the SGL's picked a couple more topics to include and mention them in the CD.13 Oct 2018 10:41 am: David Bliss
I found the 2001 version of the book (used) for under $5. But the newer version seems to be much more expensive (over $100).  Is there a reason why they require the 2017 version?  Or do they mean the 2009 version? There is room in the CD to mention some of the new fad diets like the paleo diet.  Will they be analysing some of these diets?13 Oct 2018 12:34 pm: Susan Harris
David, I don't know where you were looking, but the 2017 edition of the book is $13.59 at Amazon today (paperback).13 Oct 2018 5:52 pm: Ron Ebert
Cd is a bit short. Might give an example of “flip flp” advice. And yes, stay away from self help approach.24 Oct 2018 9:40 pm: Fred Chanania

The Atticus Finch in this book is a racist, someone from whom his daughter, returning from living in the North, recoils. This study group will explore the two books in depth while also analyzing the movie adaptation.  Why did Lee's original publishers reject <em>Watchman</em> and steer her toward writing what eventually became <em>Mockingbird? </em>Why did she portray Atticus as a folk hero in <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> but make him much less appealing in <em>Go Set a </em><em>Watchman</em>?

Appealing CD, but would like an idea of the kinds of questions (other than examining the character of Atticus Finch) that the SG will pursue since the two books together and separately raise a myriad of question, trivial and profound. Need more information on focus, substance. It looks like two class periods will be used almost entirely to show two movies. Are the books that light that they only merit four weeks of discussion, together? 12 Oct 2018 6:18 pm: Frank Speizer
Sara suggests the movies will be shown in class.  I don't quite get that from reading the CD.  Since they are listed in the other required materials I assume they are to be seen at home and excerpts seen in class to make points.  Needs clarification.  Agree some questions, particularly directed in area of racial discrimination should be mentioned (to further justify the additional, and otherwise unrelated excerpts from additional films),  The later could be described in lesser detail or even left out and simply brought into class as additional material.  I have not read the second book, mainly because of the controversy raised by its posthumous publication, but more might be said as to why he want to use it.  With revision I think this course will work. 12 Oct 2018 6:30 pm: Mickey Zemon
Jon led this study group a year or so ago, and I heard good things about it.  My only suggestions are to delete the last sentence in the CD and remove the comma between group and on Baseball in his bio.12 Oct 2018 6:33 pm: Mickey Zemon
It must have been someone else who taught a course on To Kill a Mockingbird since he does not mention it in his bio.12 Oct 2018 7:37 pm: David Bliss
The CD speaks of excerpts from one movie: In the Heat of the Night,  and analyzing the movie To Kill a Mockingbird.  It doesn't seem like too much movie watching in a 6-week course. The titles of the movie and the books should be in italics.  12 Oct 2018 7:58 pm: Penny Revelle
Two books and a movie sound like enough material for a 6 week course to me.  Maybe the excerpts from in the Heat of the Night don't need to be in the CD, but could be noted  on the class website.  This would keep the CD more focused and help potential SGMs decide about the SG.12 Oct 2018 8:14 pm: Barbara Burr
(I think To Kill a Mockingbird was a movie in the courtroom cinema SG). If two book are being used, I would imagine the movie could be watched at home.  I would be interested to know why bring in In the Heat of the Night...or how it illuminates our understanding of Mockingbird.  No need to go into so much Oscar stuff.  Better to focus on issues raised etc.  12 Oct 2018 11:18 pm: Linda Neumann
Needs to clarify how the movies will be acquired to be seen at home.  Agree that the Heat of the Night is better left out of the CD as it doesn't seem crucial in a study of Mockingbird.  Mockingbird raises many non trivial issues which should be mentioned, other than the final words on the ""issue of racial discrimination.""    No need to give details of the Oscars.  13 Oct 2018 8:03 am: Addison Stone
I agree re the need to provide greater clarity re central questions to be addressed.  Also agree with deleting mention of Heat of the Night, unless its relevance becomes stronger with modifications re central questions. Also agree that we don't need to hear about all of the Oscars. This isn't really, or primarily, a film course. At least, I don't think it is. Jon's response to requests for revision will hopefully serve to clarify purpose.13 Oct 2018 8:44 am: Susan Harris
I agree with comments above that the CD should say less about the Oscars, leave out Heat of the Night, indicate more clearly what at-home watching will include, and (somewhere, maybe not in CD) say how SGMs may obtain the movies if they need to.  With space saved from reducing Oscar verbiage, the CD could also say a bit more about specific questions to be addressed in the course.  Should be a good course and the addition of Go Set A Watchman is a plus because of its fairly recent release.13 Oct 2018 5:58 pm: Ron Ebert
Agree with above comments- omit heat of the night, oscar details and add topics for discussion. Good idea for a course, especially with addition of watchman15 Oct 2018 9:55 am: Helen Bakeman

Other required materials:  If these are being shown in class, they do not belong in this section.  Why is In the Heat of the Night still included here?  It is no longer mentioned in the CD.

Could be an interesting SG, though I know nothing about Valerie. Does she have relevant expertise in music and/or teaching beyond what she says in the Bio? I like the description of the book on Amazon ("" shows how operas give musical and dramatic expression to ideas about the self, society, and history""). Will this be part of the course? If so, it would be good to say something about that.
In sentence 1, should ""opera buffa"" be changed to ""comic operas,"" given that the final sentence suggests an interest in attracting those without opera experience? In any case, that sentence makes for a rather dull lead-in. Could add a touch of intrigue by saying something like,""Why did two of our most renowned opera composers base works on the same play? How do they differ, and how do those differences affect us?"" I don't the list of shared characters adds much.
Under Other Required Materials, it might be better to say simply ""Listening to selected recordings of the operas in the Loeb Music Library collection.""
 Is it realistic to plan for ""occasional visitors, a performing musician, and a real live conductor"" in a 6-week SG? Has Valerie led previous SGs? Bio needs condensing.11 Oct 2018 5:46 pm: David Bliss
Valerie is a new SGL, and she does not have the musicology expertise that Ron Goodman has, but she was enthusiastic at the brown bag meeting. Since this will be given in the second half and Ron's will be the first half, the two SGs will not be competing.  If the SGMs are to listen to both entire operas in class, there will not be a lot of time left for the discussions.  She is quite certain that her friend and conductor will visit one class session.  I am uncertain as to how she will lead the discussions.  Does she have a list of questions for the class? 11 Oct 2018 6:23 pm: Mickey Zemon
Valerie has been at HILR for five years and has been thinking about giving a course on opera over the past year or so.
She has great enthusiasm for opera and knows a great deal about it.
I am wondering if the title should be changed to Figaro, Figaro: Mozart vs Rossini (: rather than ;)
Sentence that starts with Yet, because Rossini is no Mozart needs to be improved - perhaps dashes after Mozart and after compositions.
In the next to the last sentence ""We shall explore those differences"" she should say how --e.g., through reading, viewing  and listening to portions of the operas, and class discussion.  We should find out  just how much class time will be used viewing the operas.  Will some operas be viewed or listed to at home as part of class preparation?
  11 Oct 2018 6:26 pm: Mickey Zemon
that orange round smiling face was a semi-colon followed by a parenthesis but computer thought
; followed by ) was ;)12 Oct 2018 9:47 am: Barbara Burr
I think this sounds like a wonderful introduction to learning about at least some aspects of opera.  It is not a music theory course obviously, but for anyone wanting to gain new perspectives on understanding opera, it seems worthwhile.  (And people who teach art courses or literature courses at HILR are often not artists or English professors, so I think this is in the same vein.)  Agree with Mickey's edits.12 Oct 2018 10:07 am: Linda Neumann
Agree with Mickey.  It should be clear that members are listening to the operas at home - at least I assume so-  and listening to selected portions during class.   She can put the music directly onto the course website, using whatever performances she chooses.  Probably better to have everyone listen to the same version.   Perhaps change "" Rossini is no Mozart"" to ""Rossini is not Mozart"" - seems dismissive of Rossini.  She can take out the cast of characters and add something about discussing the book.  Should appeal to opera buffs.12 Oct 2018 3:43 pm: Susan Harris
I think the CD is pretty good the way it is, but agree that it should be clearer about what is expected for homework (agreeing with Mickey's last comment).  12 Oct 2018 3:51 pm: Helen Bakeman
With the edits suggested, this looks  good to go. The bio could use some trimming, something like....”While in college, VA spent many Saturday’s taking the “opera bus” to the Met”, delete second sentence, delete “then” from 3rd sentence.12 Oct 2018 4:01 pm: Katherine O'Connor
I think it's great that Valerie is finally offering a study group.  She is an excellent class contributor and will not, I am confident, be a boring SGL.  I agree with Addison that opera buffa is best rendered as comic operas and that the shared characters don't need to be named. The CD could be more specific about the most striking differences between the two operas.   12 Oct 2018 5:51 pm: Frank Speizer
The book sounds good but I am concerned with how the librettos will be used.  If these are just to follow the text in a class listening session it seems like as others have indicated that too much class time will be simply listening.  Given the 10 years of HD Opera from the Met both these operas have probably been done and are probably available for home viewing.(need to check public as well as Loeb Library).  Like suggestion above for putting some contrasting questions in CD.  With modest revision, think this is an ACCEPT12 Oct 2018 8:11 pm: Penny Revelle
I actually like the CD the way it is, except for some clarification about where and when the operas will be watched.  She could also say in the 9th sentence ""We shall explore those differences and discuss the ideas in Robinson's book.""  to give some idea about how the course will be conducted.
If she is not showing both whole operas in class then I think she has room for performing musicians and a conductor.  13 Oct 2018 3:39 pm: Sara Freedman
Intriguing course. Needs a jazzier opening. One suggestion: ""Two of our most famous and beloved Italian comic operas, Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro (1786) and Rossini's Barber of Seville (1816) share many of the same elements but present the listener/viewer with very different experiences"" which would get more quickly to the heart of the course. CD also needs more information on the structure of the course and what participants are supposed to do for homework other than read the book (which is very interesting and provides a sound intellectual and musical background for the course.) One other item about the book: the chapter on the two operas is the first chapter and nothing else in the book is pertinent. Would it be cheaper to use Gnomon to copy that chapter, get copyright, etc so that people don't have to buy the entire book?
Not sure about Valerie's expertise in subject matter, particularily her ability to lead discussions on the musical aspects important to the course. Suggest a discussion with her about that.17 Oct 2018 2:13 pm: Ron Ebert

Much improved
First sentence -- add another dash after opera and add two dashes after (1816)
Add space after self in self,society and history
We will view selected performances of each opera in class with full viewing/ listening to be done at home.  Suggest rephrasing this to We will watch selections from each opera in class and view them in their entirety at home.  
Next to last sentence: replace together with class discussion with through viewing, listening, reading, and discussing these operas in class

[Workflow note] Book choice must be discussed with Herb.  Current edition is 7th, and is very pricey still.  Herb wants 5th edition; 6th edition is available at cheap price and may not be as outdated.

A good, solid topic for anyone wanting an introduction to cell biology.  2nd sentence should be ""progress...that reveals...and demonstrates...""  ""These cellular life units"" could be more succinctly replaced by ""cells"" or ""individual cells""...Since the course is called ""The Human Cell,"" might include a little more in the CD that illustrates the relevance of cellular biology to human biology/physiology.10 Oct 2018 9:24 pm: Sara Freedman
I had to drop out of a similar course because it was much too difficult for someone without a solid science/biology background. Could be a great course for those who do have such a background.10 Oct 2018 9:48 pm: Mickey Zemon
I think this will be a terrific class, and know people who are still raving about the last class on cells that Herb led a few years ago.  It will be tough for people who do not have a background in biology and/or chemistry but there are many people at HILR who do have this background.
Regarding the book: a used copy of the 6th edition is available from Barnes &amp; Nobles for $4.42. 
The title of the book is not The Cell. A Molecular Approach but The Cell: A Molecular Approach
4th line up from bottom of CD:  it says assigned cell biology textbook sources -- are these in addition to the text for the course?  Also mentions a topic review --perhaps need to explain what that is exactly.
Other required materials: Suggest changing sentence to -- Other materials, both written and visual, will be made available on the course website.  I do not think this is the place to state Brief presentations by SG members with special interests in relevant topics will be considered.  

11 Oct 2018 9:24 am: Ron Ebert
Sounds as if prior background is necessary based on sara’s experience. Mickey- what is the title? Issue of book and edition has to be simplified and clarified.11 Oct 2018 2:44 pm: Addison Stone
Should be of great appeal to those with science backgrounds. Agree that he should use either the 6th or 7th edition. Knowledge in this area is moving fast! Judy may be right that used copies of the 6th edition is a reasonable compromise, though I did find paperback copies of the 7th ed at Amazon for $68, which I think is not unreasonable for a science text. Agree about deleting the last sentence from Other Required. Note that he says only that SGM presentations will be ""considered."" I see no reason to put this sentence anywhere. 
In sentence 2, the subject is ""progress,"" so both ""reveal"" and ""demonstrate"" need a final -s. Need a comma after ""environment"" in third sentence, and after ""functions"" in fourth sentence. Suggest breading sentence 4 into two sentences.
Given what folks say about the difficulty level of the previous offering, does the statement that past courses are ""helpful but not essential"" present a problem re truth in advertising?
Minor point: Not sure that we need to know that he was an NIH-supported PI.11 Oct 2018 6:04 pm: David Bliss
I took this course from Herb last year.  His lectures were accessible to non-scientists, but demanding for those who want to go deeper.  It is a fascinating story. The book was very helpful for anyone who wants to go deeper than the class lectures. The book I used was a used 5th or 6th edition that was about $15.  The precise edition is not important, because they all have similar illustrations and diagrams. Just the chapter numbers may be different.11 Oct 2018 10:52 pm: Helen Bakeman
I think that Herb’s caveat about “helpful but not essential” clearly conveys that this will be a stretch but possible for non scientists (I am taking such a science course now and I learn what I can and am very pleased when I understand things).  I am not sure what the last phrase in the third to last sentence means or if it is needed (“the latter to include....”).

The CD gives a clear sense, I think, of the possible hurdles that those totally uninformed about the topic will face. They're not completely discouraged from signing up, but they're certainly forewarned.12 Oct 2018 6:27 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with much of the above.  I talked with Herb at the Brown Bag, and he indicated he is offering this course again, as he was told there was a waiting list last time.  (Can we check on how the evaluations went?)  Should the CD specify this is a lecture course (if that is what it is)?  In bio, take out his funding by NIH.  13 Oct 2018 11:57 am: Susan Harris
In light of David's comments, I don't think we should change much here.  I think that use of multiple editions of the text is OK and that potential SGMs have been adequately warned of the course difficulty.  The language could be tightened up a little as others have mentioned, and I agree that possible SGM presentations can be left out of Other Required Materials.13 Oct 2018 1:52 pm: Linda Neumann
I guess the book issue is OK and Herb can clarify it for the members.  Otherwise, with minor edits, seems ready to go.18 Oct 2018 9:39 pm: Jim Whitters

I concur with both Mickey and Sara----we should cut to the chase and find out whether he wants to lead the course in the Spring or really wants to lead it next Fall or later. The course needs clarification of structure but it certainly has the potential to be an interesting offering.09 Oct 2018 11:18 pm: Helen Bakeman
This is Len’s first term at HILR so it is wonderful that he is seriously getting ready to lead a study group.  This needs more detail/development of the CD and serious trimming of the bio but is a good start.10 Oct 2018 9:09 am: Addison Stone
Sounds quite intriguing, but he himself says that there's too much prep work involved to be ready for the spring semester. So, encourage him to tinker with the CD along the lines suggested above and hold off on resubmitting until the call for fall proposals goes out.10 Oct 2018 11:17 am: Barbara Burr
Agree with all the comments. Fine dea for a study group.10 Oct 2018 11:35 am: Penny Revelle
I agree this is a great idea for a study group.  Because he doesn't want to teach next spring, he should be referred to the TLC for help with the CD.  Suggest the following for the biography:
Len Sussman is a recently retired architect. He now returns to the interests - drawing and painting - that first inspired him. To that end, he shares in the management of the Boston Figurative Art Center, which offers open studio opportunities for both aspiring and experienced artists in the local area. 10 Oct 2018 12:52 pm: Ron Ebert
Agree with above, but lets be sure to encourage him and support this venture. Is a trip to both the harvard museums and mfa too much?10 Oct 2018 1:25 pm: Katherine O'Connor
Wonderful topic!  Assume that some of the comments can be addressed before the course would appear in the catalogue. 12 Oct 2018 10:20 am: David Bliss
Since this is proposal not ready for Spring, I suggest that we send him a copy of the ""tips for writing a good proposal"" and tell him to think about his proposal again, and that the word limits need to be observed.12 Oct 2018 6:37 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with Penny and David in particular and with others.  He does not really appear to be thinking of the Spring and could use some consultation with TLC.  He probably could find all he needs at Harvard Museum without including the MFA.  I think he also will put off people if he want to do some sketching in class.  (those who already draw won't need it, and those who don't won't want to try).  Defer, and resubmit or suggest withdraw, but in either case ENCOURAGE!

Good CD and interesting topic.
First sentence: Why are the F and T in Cosi fan tutte not in upper-case letters?
He needs a concluding sentence that explains how the course is going to be structured.  What percentage of class time is going to be used to view the operas?  How much time discussing the book?
The book he is using is 428 pages long, a substantial amount of reading per class for 6 weeks. 
Other required materials: What and how much online materials in ""links to articles, podcasts and performances"" (as well as memoir and operas in line two) is he referring to?  Even with a 3 hour workload, this seems like a great deal of class preparation.
Also in  Other required materials: on-line should be online08 Oct 2018 4:14 pm: Ron Ebert
Concur with Mickey- how will he use the six weeks? The book alone averages 70 pgs per week. The operas/ libretto alone are worth a course, and the life story may be also. Is 12 weeks a better target?08 Oct 2018 7:59 pm: Sara Freedman
Agree with comments above in terms of class organization and edits. Would also like some sense of the kinds of questions that will be pursued. Right now it seems as though the class will be going through the accomplishments of his life, sort of a time line. Other than his remarkable list of diverse occupations, what makes his life intriguing, special, worth studying? And how are you born a Jew and become a priest (not that that cannot happen, but Ron seems to just stick that in there with no explanation.)08 Oct 2018 9:00 pm: Penny Revelle
I suggest changing the 3rd (?) sentence to: The librettist for Mozart's operas Don Giovanni, Cosi Fan Tutte and the Marriage of Figaro was a fascinating character who was born a Jew in (Venice?), converted to Christianity and became a priest, and then moved to New York City.""  Don't need to say he was on the faculty at Columbia University twice.
Then I would add a final sentence about how the course will be conducted - something like ""We will watch slide presentations, hear parts of Mozart's operas and discuss Bolt's spellbinding biography.""  I don't think he has any intention of going into the librettos in any depth.08 Oct 2018 9:02 pm: Dick Rubinstein
Yes, this can be a very interesting course. I agree with all of the above concerns. Re Così fan tutte, this is the correct capitalization, I believe. Also, it needs the diacritical mark over the I in Così. A 12-week course could have a more-reasonable reading load, and could take in more of the librettos and Mozart’s music. Ron has taught 3 or more courses, so he should be open to this discussion of the course structure. With some massaging, a winner.08 Oct 2018 9:24 pm: Barbara Burr
Seems like a most intriguing subject for a study group.  I think 70 pages of reading is OK (some seminars are 100 or more) unless the book is particularly dense.  I am not so clear whether the main point of the seminar is opera or the story of this man's life...maybe it's hard to do both justice in 6 wks?  08 Oct 2018 9:25 pm: Linda Neumann
I like Penny's suggestions, except I don't think he plans many  slide presentations as he mentions in the comments.  Since probably the most interesting part of his career (from our view today) is his work on Mozart's operas,  I was expecting to see some more mention of how that happened and how they worked together .  09 Oct 2018 8:39 pm: Frank Speizer
I agree not clear if this is about the man or the making of the librettos for the 6weeks.  For both may need 12. In either case this should go well. 09 Oct 2018 11:27 pm: Helen Bakeman
Da Ponte sounds worthy of study and Penny’s suggested revisions will make the CD more inviting and clear.10 Oct 2018 9:04 am: Addison Stone
Good potential, but I agree that the current write-up leaves the reader unsure about whether the focus is on the man's life or on his writing of librettos. Either could be the sole focus of a 6-week SG. If he really wants to do both, he should say more about the librettos in the CD (what's particularly intriguing about them?), and then expand the format to 10 or 12 weeks.11 Oct 2018 5:22 pm: David Bliss
Agree with Penny's edits.  The style of the CD is engaging, but need more in13 Oct 2018 12:27 pm: Susan Harris
This sounds like a good course.  I like Penny's edits.  The CD is very short - some of the extra space should be used to 1) give a better idea of how the class will be conducted, 2) give a better idea of what the preparation will be, and 3) clarify how much of the focus is about the man vs. the operas/librettos.  17 Oct 2018 10:11 am: Katherine O'Connor

An improvement. Now seems more squarely focused on the man, with the libretto's as only one aspect. Agree with Mickey's suggested change to Other Required Materials.

Should the emphasis be on excellence? Individual development? Diversity? Fairness? Who should decide? Who should work in this profession, and who should pay for it?

Now with cheating scandals, school closings, and teacher evaluations increasingly determined by student performance on state tests, more people are taking notice. The Federal government has attempted to help and influence beleaguered schools since the 1960s, but programs like No Child Left Behind and others have lured the press and partisan politics into the discussion. Opinions on charter schools, Common Core, and Teach for America have fractured long-standing educational alliances and led to unlikely bedfellows.

Very good topic, but no way to attack all those issues in six weeks - or even 12. Could she be assisted to  narrow her scope? Perhaps think of this as the first of a series of courses on edaction policy? How about our current education secretary? That would be worth a single course.07 Oct 2018 5:26 pm: Addison Stone
I agree with Ron that this is an important topic area, but that there is too much here. The book is quite good (Nancy used it in a study group two years ago, which I was in), but it too covers a lot of territory, and, inevitably, does so a bit superficially. Agree that zeroing in on a smaller set of issues would make sense, especially for a 6-week SG (the earlier one was 12 weeks). I’m also a bit worried about Nancy’s plan to devote the first hour of each session to discussion of material from the book (which is largely organized historically) and the second hour to “contemporary issues.” How will the two segments each week be connected? Will the additional readings help to bridge the gap? Asking her to give us examples of topics (for both the first and second hours) and readings for each of two weeks would help us see how she plans to organize the material.

Not sure how to punctuate the second sentence. The third sentence “Who should decide…” is quite awkward. Sentence beginning “With teachers’ unions…” is also awkward, even after “in part by” is changed to “in part on,” as it should be. Finally, in the last sentence: one doesn’t “hear from” films, and who are the visitors? Nancy invited visitors to her earlier SG on this topic, and the link to on-going topics was meager. This would be even more of a problem with only 6 weeks to devote to the material.
07 Oct 2018 8:29 pm: Barbara Burr
I love the idea of a study group on public school education, but this one leaves my head spinning.  Maybe clarifying and focusing on some key issues such as role of the federal government vs local, how to help failing schools (issues of resource distribution etc), meeting the needs of economically disadvantaged children, what are the common demoninators of ""excellent"" schools, etc. How do we attract excellent teachers? I am not so sure about the notion we are ""special friends"" to children - everyone should be concerned about children's education.  I am certain Nancy has much to offer and can teach an excellent seminar on education.07 Oct 2018 9:00 pm: Mickey Zemon
I agree with the comments above. 
Perhaps she would consider expanding the study group to 12 weeks rather than trimming down what she wants to cover to fit into 6 weeks.
Deleting the last sentence is one good way to get rid of 13 words. It should be pretty easy to cut at least that amount from other places in the CD.
Other required materials:  This should say Other materials will be provided on the course website.07 Oct 2018 9:16 pm: Sara Freedman
I agree that there is far too much to cover in a six week course, probably even for a  12 week one. To create a stronger focus, perhaps a series of overarching questions would help: What are the connecting tissues that together might make sense of the issues as a whole? These might include who gets a say in school reform, what are the major trends in school reform, and how have these campaigns affected major constitutiences? 08 Oct 2018 8:18 am: Susan Harris
This is an interesting topic from an SGL with excellent relevant experience.  The CD lists many topics to be covered, probably too many as others have pointed out.  If the course remains 6 weeks long, it should be better focused on fewer questions.  I agree with Addison that the book discussion in the first hour and the contemporary issues discussion in the second hour should be integrated somehow (or that structure could be changed.08 Oct 2018 9:21 am: Penny Revelle
Interesting topic, but it does need to be better focused on a smaller group of issues and questions.
I think this laudry-list of a sentence could be left out without losing anything in describing the study group: ""With teachers' unions, charter schools, school shootings, cheating scandals, school closings and teachers' evaluations based in part by their students' performance on state tests, there are decisions to be made at the local, state and federal level.""
Also I wonder how films and visitors are going to be fit into a 6 week timeframe.  Maybe one visitor and one film or change to a 12 week course.  I expect Nancy has a good reason for wanting to do it in 6 weeks this second time     and asking her about it would clarify what should be included in the SG.
But basically our job, as I see it, is to help her craft a reasonable course description for the catalogue and then we should shift her over to the TLC for some mentoring on how to craft the course itself.08 Oct 2018 9:22 am: Penny Revelle
PS. I like being thought of as a ""special friend"" of the new generations.08 Oct 2018 9:54 am: David Bliss
This should be a 12-week course.  If she can only do a 6-week, she should refine the focus of the course to a few of the concepts listed in the CD.  Either way, it will be a great course.08 Oct 2018 9:01 pm: Linda Neumann
Agree that it needs more focus - even for 12 weeks the list of topics is overwhelming.  Agree with Penny that the laundry list does not add anything important to the CD.  
She talks about government action in the 60's and then in the last sentence, she returns to say we will learn how these  issues developed in the past.  I would like to see some mention of the present and the future.  Will we learn about the present, government action (or inaction) today?  What are the trends for the future?  What decisions or help should we offer to our special friends?09 Oct 2018 10:54 am: Katherine O'Connor
I agree that the topic is great but that the material to be covered seems too vast for a six-week course.  I favor a refocusing of a six-week course rather than an extending of it into a twelve-week course because the added time will not necessarily make the focus of the course more clear. 09 Oct 2018 11:16 am: Frank Speizer
Not much to add.  Grat topic, far too much for 6 weeks.  kind of like the idea of selection oof one of a series of topics to be tackled over several courses but Nancy suggests she has other ideas to join up with another SGL infuture.  Suggest we give her option to narrow the focus or extend to 12 weeks. 09 Oct 2018 11:26 am: Helen Bakeman
I too believe that as currently written there is far too much for a 6 week course.  It may need to be trimmed back even if she expands it to 10 weeks.  Focus on education and try to ignore shootings, cheating etc.09 Oct 2018 2:19 pm: Addison Stone

[Workflow note] Nancy has agreed to increase the number of classes to 10. The CD has been re-written and corresponds with the CD Nancy utilized when she led the same course in the Spring, 2016. The number of words in the CD has been reduced to 157.17 Oct 2018 8:56 am: Addison Stone
This is still basically an “assorted issues about education” class, but at least it has been expanded to 10 weeks. Also, the addition of the second book (which Nancy also used in her earlier offering of this SG) is good since it deals more squarely with school reform issues (the original book is more focused on the teaching profession). So, although I would still prefer a more tightly focused set of issues, we’ve said our piece, and I think we should let her have her party. 
Given the expansion to 10 weeks, the statement in Additional Schedule Info should now be deleted.
Need a comma after “1960s”, and should that be “1960’s”?
I think we’re using commas after the second item in a three-item list. There are 2 or 3 such places in the CD.
17 Oct 2018 11:46 am: Jim Whitters
[Workflow note] have made all of the edits in the CD that Addison has recommended. For whatever reason I cannot strike Nancy's response under the heading ADDITIONAL SCHEDULE INFORMATION that Addison has also recommended.17 Oct 2018 12:02 pm: Sara Freedman
Agree with Addison's comments. Improved but still seems overly diffuse. I'm also wondering if those not immersed in the education wars are familiar with terms such as ""No child left behind"" and the others. Do they add anything to the CD that would help people understand the nature of the course or are they examples of much lamented educational jargon? 17 Oct 2018 12:56 pm: Barbara Burr
I think it still seems a bit overwhelming.  While probably most people have heard of the federalinitiatives mentioned, I think the deeper questions are what if anything has improved our public education and what real reform in the future would involve.17 Oct 2018 1:25 pm: Mickey Zemon
I think this is a very important class and Nancy is very well qualified to lead it.
My only suggestion is to change Assigned shorter readings will be provided by the leader to Additional materials will be made available on the course website.  This does assume that she is going to post them on the course website and not hand them out in class. Do we know the answer to this?

We will examine the literature, art, and architecture of this new Boston, with due recognition given to its growing ethnic and religious tensions. An extraordinary generation of writers, artists, architects, and philanthropists created some of Boston’s best-loved institutions, including the Museum of Fine Arts, the Boston Public Library, the Gardner Museum, Trinity Church, the Back Bay landfill project, and the Emerald Necklace. We will study these monuments to civic pride as well as the less flattering fictional portraits by William Dean Howells, Sarah Orne Jewett, and Henry James.

Charles Krauthammer was a Pulitzer Prize-winning, weekly-syndicated columnist and an evening commentator on Fox News. Formerly a psychiatrist and Walter Mondale-supporting Democrat, he turned Reaganite in the 1980s.

The discussion group will explore his commentary on national security, foreign policy, America’s role in the world, the post-Cold War world, as well as ethical and social issues. The class will be polled to help select topics of interest.  People often asked him, “How do you go from Walter Mondale to Fox News?” His answer was, “I was young once.” Join our discussion about what this brilliant, principled conservative had to say, and see if you are persuaded.","1","","Jim","","Sloman","","jimsloman@gmail.com","6179476268","1","","","","","","","","","","Krauthammer, Charles|Things That Matter: Three Decades of Passions, Pastimes and Politics|Random House|2015|","","","","","<strong>Readings: </strong>Krauthammer, Charles, <em>Things That Matter: Three Decades of Passions, Pastimes and Politics</em>&nbsp;(Random House, 2015).","Estimated outside work is one hour per week.

Wow.  I am already converted.  
Seriously, Obviously much too long.  He could (should) leave out the entire first dialogue or whatever it is.  
I think it could use a sentence about an opportunity for a serious dialogue with conservative commentary.
Second sentence (not counting opening paragraph) should be broken up.
Cut the first part of the third sentence  about being divided into four parts.
Last two sentences could be changed

Jim is a serious and articulate conservative.  Could be good06 Oct 2018 9:23 am: Dick Rubinstein
I’m all for some intelligent, anti-polarized political discussion. Yes, the “dialog” should go, in part because the CD must be a single paragraph, but I don’t think it adds much and the CD is too long. What does he mean that the discussion group is divided into four parts? Is this discussions over time, or sub-groups in each session? Note that SGL has taught one previous course (count is listed next to his name). Do we know how that course went? I’m positive on the proposal.

The fussy stuff: In the first sentence, “If there WERE living gods... WOULD sit...” I’ll let David deal with the commas.06 Oct 2018 9:45 am: Barbara Burr
I imagine Charles Krauthammer's writings and perspective could generate good and perhaps needed discussions.  I don't understand the ""four parts,"" and I think the last two sentences of the CD are annoying in various ways.  One other small matter: no one says ""psychiatric physician"" rather than psychiatrist.  Book reference is incomplete.06 Oct 2018 9:49 am: Mickey Zemon
Agree with Linda and Dick -- cut the four lines at the top.
The first sentence confuses me: If there is a living god. First, Krauthammer is no longer living;  second, if he sits atop the pantheon that suggests there are other living gods which contradicts the first part of the sentence. 
What is a psychiatric physician?  A psychiatrist?  Add a comma before  and Walter Mondale in that sentence and end it after Reaganite.  Start the next sentence with This study group will read his book, Things That Matter, ...
What is divided into four parts? Cut that sentence after “Democratic Realism.”
Delete the last sentence.
Important to have a course like this to represent a conservative perspective.06 Oct 2018 9:51 am: Mickey Zemon
Delete the last two sentences is what I meant to say06 Oct 2018 5:21 pm: Addison Stone
Jim was a valuable and productive SGM in a course I taught 2 years ago on the Opportunity Gap, which was otherwise populated by a bunch of liberals agreeing with each other. A knowledgeable, articulate, and balanced spokesperson for the conservative perspective. His first SG is not until the second half of this term, so no data there, but I suspect that he'll do reasonably well. 

Re the current proposal, I agree that it has great potential. Also agree re the need to cut the CD, most obviously by deleting the up-front dialogue, along with the last two sentences. Does he really want folks to spend only 1 hour/week reading/reflecting? Doesn't seem enough to fuel rich discussion. I haven't seen the book, but I wonder to what extent the essays will stand on their own. Any need for background readings on selected issues, and/or for contrasting position pieces?

  HOWEVER, all of these comments may be premature. Note that he says ""Not this spring."" I think he's aiming for next fall. Should clarify, and then give him suggestions for reworking the CD, and perhaps the work load.06 Oct 2018 5:33 pm: Sara Freedman
Agree with above comments. No need to give us a summary of the book or all of the highlights of K's career but rather the major questions that the book and the group will be raising and why the author is particularly adept at raising them. 
Would like sense of the nature of the course - lecture, discussion, etc.
I assume the last sentence is tongue in cheek but it doesn't appeal to me. 
06 Oct 2018 11:04 pm: Penny Revelle
Yeah, I think the dialogue has to go, but I'm not against trying to inject a little humor into political discussions, so he could put it on the class website.
The second sentence in the main paragraph could profitably be divided into 3 sentences.  
It's not clear what would be divided into four parts - the SG or the topics to be discussed.
I would leave out the last sentence.
I'm also not against a rousing discussion, but it sounds to me like the SGL means to have a knock down-drag out set of sessions with the liberals among us.  Does the SGL have plans on how he will keep things civilized?07 Oct 2018 10:36 am: Jim Whitters
as an unyielding liberal I welcome a course that at the core presents the class with a quite classic Burkean conservative's writings. I think that the sentence that begins ""Few on the left...."" could be tamed a bit by comparing Krauthammer to what is best in American political thinking and writing, conservative or liberal. I talked with Jim about the course on Wednesday at our session with possible Proposers and sensed that he is committed to a good debate but with a good dose of civility.07 Oct 2018 4:12 pm: Ron Ebert
Not much more to add- we are a good place for such a course. Hehas plenty of time to slim it down, add commas and clarify that the book has four parts- but that can be cut too.08 Oct 2018 8:50 am: Susan Harris
I applaud this effort to get people with differing political viewpoints to listen to and educate each other in a civil, maybe even enjoyable way.  It's good that the opening sentence gets across Krauthammer's lofty place among conservative commentators, but I agree with Mickey that the ""living god"" metaphor doesn't quite work.  There are also many other writing problems, mentioned above.  The last two sentences need to go if the opening dialog is dropped (as it should be).09 Oct 2018 11:14 am: Katherine O'Connor
I welcome a course on Krauthammer, but I'm critical of the paper-tiger (Goldberg and O'Donnell) opening. This implies that the critics of this ""god"" are all in the same league.09 Oct 2018 11:29 am: Frank Speizer
Not much to add in that this might be a talked about course if it were to run.  I think the CD needs major re-write.  The second sentence could be considerably shortened. and the next as others have said needs clarification. 09 Oct 2018 11:35 pm: Helen Bakeman
Great that Jim is doing this. Agree re: deleting dialogue and the reference to it in the next to last sentence.  Delete reference to book being divided into 4 parts.  When listing what the course will focus on, it would be better if he indicated this generally (foreign policy etc.) rather then citing the titles of the sections or chapter13 Oct 2018 4:42 pm: David Bliss

A few small edits to this very impressive CD:
Title - start all the words with upper case letters except for the and and.  The last word should be Works, not work
First sentence: after century, add Francis Crick so we know about whom he is talking.  Next sentence could be: How did he think, collaborate, compete, and arrive at his “Aha!” moments?
Next sentence: My goal is that the poets among us --what about all of us who are not poets?
Next to last sentence: change you can appreciate to we can appreciate.
Last sentence:  change to All questions will be encouraged.  There are no stupid questions at HILR!
05 Oct 2018 11:30 am: Sara Freedman
Agree with Mickey's editorial suggestions. Think first sentence should repeat the nature of Crick's discovery that is presented in the title: not everyone will know immediately to what he is referring. 
The course should appeal to those soles who are neither scientists nor poets - which is most of us. SGL seems extremely well qualified to give this course. I can't find if he has taught a course at HILR before. If this is his first, it seems a perfect course for him to begin as a SGL. Wonder if he will include some of the controversy about who were actually the discoverers(Rosalind Franklin, for example), as this adds interest to and important information about the nature of scientific discovery and practice at the time and into today.05 Oct 2018 12:02 pm: Ron Ebert
Wonderful idea for a course. I agree with Mickey and Sara about shortening first sentence and naming Crick. There are three sentences begining “we will”.05 Oct 2018 12:43 pm: Addison Stone
A good idea for a course, and an engaging CD. I agree with Mickey's suggestions, especially the last one. Also, the second sentence seems a bit awkward; should there be a comma after ""non-life""?  I did a double-take on the title. If you don't know that ""What Mad Pursuit"" is the name of Crick's autobiography, then it's hard to make sense of the phrasing. Would it be better to omit the title and incorporate it into the CD? In the spirit of changing ""stupid questions,"" I would omit ""science-phobes."" Begins to suggest a dumbing-down of the material.05 Oct 2018 2:52 pm: Penny Revelle
I believe this course was given once before and went very well.  I would leave ""science-phobes"" in but change the ""stupid questions"" to Mickey's wording, but that's just personal preference.  
Otherwise it looks like a great course.05 Oct 2018 4:30 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with above edits, but would be even more forceful in suggesting that Rosalind Franklin be mentioned by name and not just be part of the ""other"".  Also agree there are no stupid questions at HILR.  With edits ACCEPT05 Oct 2018 5:40 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree with edits, especially adding Watson to the title instead of the book name. (More people have probably heard of The Double Helix).  Very much would like some inclusion of Franklin.  Who are the “other autobiographies?”  Don’t want course to come across as geared to people prone to asking stupid questions!05 Oct 2018 8:01 pm: David Bliss
Lindsay Peter White gave a SG on Water, the Molecule about a year ago, which got some very good reviews.  This is another science class, but I suspect it would appeal to scientists as well as non-scientists.  He certainly has the background for it, so no need to dumb it down so much.  Besides, this is mainly a biography study group.  Is there a need for short autobiographical excerpts to be distributed if both autobiographies are required reading?  05 Oct 2018 9:20 pm: Linda Neumann
Interesting topic about how scientists operate and the process of scientific discovery.  Is Rosie Franklin one of the other contemporaries?  If so, she deserves mention in the CD.  Agree that there are no stupid questions.  
Remember, have to take the hyphen out of non-scientists.   Personally don’t like “science phobes”
Also, I question the “just” in “just enough molecular biology “.  It seems to dumb it down.06 Oct 2018 9:31 am: Dick Rubinstein
FYI, all, previous courses taught is listed to the right of the SGL’s name. ""3 or more,"" in this case. Only the first line in “Other Required Materials” belongs there (and in the catalog). The rest should be moved to “Other Preparation” (not for catalog). Above suggestions for wording are good. I agree that Rosalind Franklin should be named explicitly. Further, I’d like to see the movie be shown in a session, not as a lunch-time option, and also provide a more-critical stance in the CD on who gets the credit for the discoveries. It’ll be a good course!06 Oct 2018 9:33 am: Dick Rubinstein
P.S. The loss of the last letter “s” in the title is because the title is already the 70-character limit. An m-dash instead of space-hyphen-space will fix this.08 Oct 2018 9:03 am: Susan Harris
I agree with Mickey's edits, mentioning Crick, and removing ""science-phobes"" and ""stupid questions"".  ""Non-scientists"" sufficiently describes the intended audience.  I agree with Dick that the movie should be shown during class, not during lunch when many other activities take place at HILR.09 Oct 2018 11:21 am: Katherine O'Connor
I agree with the suggested edits and with the desirability of including a mention of Franklin. I also agree with David's question - given the required reading - about the necessity of including short autobiographical excerpts. Accept with edits.11 Oct 2018 7:37 am: Barbara Burr
[Workflow note] The CD and title are rewritten to emphasize that the course is really the story of Crick.  The ""dumbing down"" was eliminated. I cannot correct the unnecessary bold in the bio for some reason...17 Oct 2018 4:06 pm: Barbara Burr

Since 1900, a broad range of cultural, social, economic, and political forces have shaped the development of American metropolitan areas. These forces are reflected in the decisions about how and where all of us have chosen to live during the course of our lifetimes. This study group will look at American urban history during the last century, which has been characterized as involving three phases: central city ascendancy (1900-1945), central city decline and suburbanization (1945-1980), and post-suburban metropolis (1980-present). Although every American city has a unique character, which is a function of its history, location, demographics, culture, and economy, the trajectory of American urban development has been surprisingly consistent. Participants will be encouraged to connect their own lifestyle experiences to this urban planning framework, providing a mix of discussion and lecture elements.","3","","Beverly","","Bookin","","bookin@bookingroup.com","978-789-4496","0","","","","","","","","","","Jon Teaford|The Twentieth-Century American City: Problem, Promise and Reality, 3rd ed.|John Hopkins UP|2016|x","||||","","","","<strong>Readings: </strong>This edition only: Jon Teaford, <em>The Twentieth-Century American City: Problem, Promise and Reality, 3rd ed.</em>&nbsp;(John Hopkins University Press, 2016); , <em></em>&nbsp;(, ).","Estimated outside work is three hours per week.

To make the CD more attractive it could raise a question like ""What has happened to the American City"".  Or some other question that will be discussed in class.  She should add the interesting note in Other Prep to the course description, so that prospective members can have an idea about how the class will be run.  The first and last sentences of the bio are all that is needed to tell the story.04 Oct 2018 10:45 pm: Helen Bakeman
I think that a sentence or two  about each of the three major trends would make it a more informative CD.  Perhaps add to last sentence something like “to understand the underlying factors that caused these changes”—something that indicates what course will be looking at. Last sentence—I don’t think that we use the term “seminar.” Spacing of book is off. I am glad that Bev is proposing this course; she described it in great detail in her admissions interview!!05 Oct 2018 9:11 am: Barbara Burr
A very good topic but CD is ""bare bones.""  I am sure she can describe the evolution of cities in a colorful and provocative way, and maybe consider where it is all going...for better or for worse...Agree with edits.  CD too short and bio too long!05 Oct 2018 9:42 am: Mickey Zemon
Sounds like a great study group by a fairly new member who should be an excellent SGL.
I agree with David, Helen and Barbara.  She needs to round out the CD and trim the bio.
Under Other required materials she says None other than the core textbook above. 
However, under Other preparation	, she says there will be 1-3 supplementary readings including newspaper/magazine articles and selected chapters of books. An example is the introductory chapter of The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York by Robert Caro.  I think this should be moved to Other required material so it is clear that participants will be expected to read these as well.

05 Oct 2018 11:10 am: David Bliss
Another suggestion: start with ""What has happened to the American cities we all grew up in?""05 Oct 2018 11:33 am: Sara Freedman
Agree with above comments. Very bland and bureaucratic as presently written. Would include some focusing questions that can raise the reader's interest about the  focus of the course; right now seems very broad and with few case studies to anchor the discussions. Perhaps could include information about the Moses reading and others in the CD itself.05 Oct 2018 11:58 am: Ron Ebert
How can i not agree with all who proceed. Cd should be expanded, book entry corrected and bio shortened. Additional required readings should be expanded05 Oct 2018 4:39 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with all of above.  The proposer certainly has expertise to lead this study group, but clearly needs help in formulating the CD.  On the other hand we cannot write it for her.  Suggest she be encouraged to scrap what she has said and start over, with encouragement from ideas presented about.  Clearly will need re-write and another review.  05 Oct 2018 9:31 pm: Linda Neumann
Beverly is certainly qualified and articulate.  The CD needs to be rewritten.  Questions, focus, future trends, problems, regional issues.  I believe that we do not use bullets in the catalog.  Is this discussion, presentation?06 Oct 2018 10:37 pm: Penny Revelle
I don't think she needs to scrap what she has written, just use it as an outline for her real CD.
Looks like an interesting course.
We aren't including degrees in the bio any more, are we?  That would shorten the bio.  Also doesn't need to say ""before moving to MA in 2016.""
Agree other prep needs to go in other require materials section. 08 Oct 2018 9:12 am: Susan Harris
I agree with Frank that the SGL should have a second go at the CD before we review it further.  As a new member she can be forgiven for submitting a proposal that doesn't follow the guidelines or resemble other catalog CDs, but she should still do the work of fixing it.  This could be a terrific course given her background.08 Oct 2018 11:30 am: Jim Whitters
Agree with Susan and Frank in recommending a re-write of the CD. The SGL described a very attractive course in our meeting with her last Wednesday and there is no doubt, given the the SGL's vast experience that this should be a terrific course.09 Oct 2018 11:29 am: Katherine O'Connor
Potentially wonderful topic in drastic need of a rewrite/re-write?.15 Oct 2018 4:52 pm: Addison Stone
[Workflow note] In response to CC comments, the CD has been recast as a single paragraph and expanded to provide a better sense of SG content/format. A sentence re required supplemental readings has been added, and the Bio has been shortened.15 Oct 2018 5:13 pm: Frank Speizer
I believe this is much better .  I tried to think about using the second sentence first and jus adding the modifiers of 80% and 70%. Last sentence is a little confusing. I think it means considering the SGMs decisions for moving in and out of a given area in more formal terms but probably needs to be reformullated, Given for most of us job opportunity was a doninate reason. ACCEPT15 Oct 2018 5:38 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree that it is much improved.  Last sentence should be reworked and probably two sentences..15 Oct 2018 6:04 pm: Mickey Zemon
Much improved.
Delete the ''the'' before Americans in the first sentence
Other required materials: replace ''posted as PDFs on the Canvas website'' with ''posted on the course website.''
When it comes to using numbers in parentheses after a colon -- we have eliminated this in other CDs and just used commas.  I think that would work better in this CD as well.

Fascinating topic, but first sentence is not very engaging. Perhaps start with “Why did it take so long to regulate lead?”04 Oct 2018 5:23 pm: David Bliss
To make it more engaging, he could put the two big questions at the beginning: Why did it take a long time to regulate well known poisons like lead? What was the role of industry, science and others on the process of assessing the dangers of these products? There is room for more information about the format of the course.  Could say in addition to reading the book, there will be additional scientific papers and current event issues posted on the web site.

I agree with Ron and David.
This is a terrific idea for a study group by a very well qualified proposer.
In the bio there is a comma after his last name that should be deleted.04 Oct 2018 10:33 pm: Helen Bakeman
Agree with David’s suggested changes. This  sounds like an excellent course. There are a number of missing commas in the CD (after “danger,” after “gasoline,” ).  The first author of the book—first name should be first05 Oct 2018 9:05 am: Barbara Burr
Good course.  I think a little more on current controversy (eg the role of the EPA and the impact of politics, global agreements etc) would make it especially relevant.  The tobacco story is kind of old news (maybe except for vaping in adolescents!)...05 Oct 2018 11:40 am: Sara Freedman
Wonder about length of course given there is only one book listed, albeit one that is highly regarded and well worth reading carefully. He does mention that he will include other readings, but would like more information. Would encourage him to include some papers that deal specifically with the intersection of the environmental regulatory system and its intersection with race, ethnicity in particular. These issues were studiously avoided in a course I took with him, which made for some peculiar gaps. 05 Oct 2018 12:29 pm: Addison Stone
Great topic, from a seemingly well-qualified SGL. I agree that front-loading the two questions would add ""spark."" Looks like a simple cut-and-paste matter. The list of specific topics seems a bit long. Perhaps omit one or two items?""Second-hand smoke"" would seem to be presumed by ""tobacco smoke,"" for example. Was the SGL's previous course on a related topic? If so, might add mention in the bio. I'm not worried about SGL filling the full term; he mentions scientific papers, etc. Shouldn't ""well known"" be hyphenated when serving as a modifier? There is a documentary based on the book. I wonder if it might be worth adding. Might serve to spark  discussion about how issues are presented to the public.05 Oct 2018 5:00 pm: Frank Speizer
As much as I am against the tobacco lobby, I have to admit (and it is true for all of the hazards discussed) they were not ""... the introduction of dangerous products into use, ....  In fact the dangers for the most part were never considered in the very early days, and only with observations, for example for tobacco, starting in the post WWII period were they considered.  (In the WWI the government  handed out cigarettes to the doe boys.  For lead we can go back to antiquity.  The issues raised in the last part of the first sentence are more germane,  Agree focusing on a couple of example of why it took so long to begin to attempt to regulate would have a greater punch as the opening sentence.   I think all the information is in the CD and I agree a rearrangement is necessary except for one major issue, which might be discussed with the proposer.  The last sentence talks about the misuse of science, but what is not mentioned is how scientific certainty is used, rather than misused, to go up against industry and their lobbies.  I think this will be a great course  with modest re-write. 05 Oct 2018 10:03 pm: Linda Neumann
Opening sentence is very bland and agree that a version of the questions would improve it.  
I am not familiar with the book but my question is does this course discuss the evolution of regulatory processes, lessons learned, and have those processes been improved?  Are objective scientific conclusions  effective or are we continued to be duped and misled?06 Oct 2018 10:30 pm: Penny Revelle
How about for a title or first sentence(s) ""Are Products Innocent Until Proven Guilty? Why Does it Take so Long To Regulate Dangerous Products?
I agree that in the penultimate sentence, if science is going to be knocked as ""misleading"" and ""politicized,"" you ought to include  something about how good science can protect the public.
The list of topics in the second sentences goes on too long and will result in the readers' eyes glazing over.  Fewer would be better.09 Oct 2018 10:01 pm: Jim Whitters
Excellent course. The role of government, in legislating into action the FDA, EPA, et al. in relation to assessing the dangers of the products and then regulating them, is a critical player in the substance of the course. 12 Oct 2018 3:25 pm: Susan Harris
[Workflow note] This is a substantially edited version that is mostly responsive to reviewer comments (more interesting beginning, addition of current event topics, more info about additional readings, more detail in general, and commas added here and there).

Great improvements to an already attractive CD. I agree with Franks' concern that many of these products were not known to be dangerous when first introduced. Did you discuss altering/eliminating the phrase ""introduction of dangerous products into use"" with the SGL? Emphasis could be shifted to slow/deceptive action as evidence of dangers began to emerge. Not a deal breaker for me, but seems a bit misleading.

Could the cd be expanded to further explore “the fight for mens souls”.is the title of the third book accurately listed? 04 Oct 2018 5:06 pm: David Bliss
I love the opening quotation.  Is it a quote from a man named Nostromo, or is it a quote from the narrator? Could the CD say more about which countries  are the subject of these novels?  I found the book under the title ""Typhoon and other Tales"" It happens to contain The secret Sharer, but not in the title.
04 Oct 2018 7:06 pm: Mickey Zemon
I think the quote should begin the paragraph and not be separated by a space above it.
In the sentence starting with The Secret Agent, there should be a comma between terrorism and is.
She mentions she will be showing a film.  Is that going to take up one entire class?  If so, will there be enough time in 6 weeks to discuss the two novels and one short story?
Other Required materials: change to Other materials will be posted on the course website.
In the bio, suggest ending the sentence with moral values and deleting their challenges facing our contemporary society.  She might want to mention some of the other literature classes she has taught such as the one on Kafka.04 Oct 2018 8:14 pm: Katherine O'Connor
I agree that the quotation is wonderful but I was hoping for some kind of connect between it and the CD that follows. The works mentioned are all great; however, a more focused and less vague and general reference to each of them would be desirable.04 Oct 2018 8:47 pm: Jim Whitters
It seems that the SGL should increase the course to 12 weeks given 2 novels, one short story and one film-----is there sufficient time for full discussion in 6 weeks? Otherwise, the course is very attractive and should be popular.04 Oct 2018 10:29 pm: Helen Bakeman
It is not clear if somehow the opening quote is a theme running through all of the novels/short story..if so, that should be made explicit.  I believe that it is a quote from the book Nostromo, one of the three to be read.  Should be a comma after 20th century in first sentence of full paragraph. In addition to Mickey’s comment about bio, it should contain her first and last names.05 Oct 2018 9:01 am: Barbara Burr
I think this should be an excellent course, but worry that 6 weeks will be rushed given the many topics and ideas to discuss in Conrad's work. Could it be 12 wks with maybe an additional story?  A sentence connecting the quote to the rest of the CD would be useful.  ""Moral ambiguity"" comes up at the end, but I think related to fixed ideas, justice and danger.  Agree with edits.05 Oct 2018 11:23 am: Addison Stone
I agree about the need to connect the quote to the rest of the CD (or omit). I also think that Mimi should seriously consider expanding the length of time, perhaps to 10 weeks, especially if the film will consume an entire session. Depends a bit, of course, on how she plans to use class time. Agree with suggestion to add something in the bio re previous study groups. Is it possible to move the sentence re Secret Sharer to precede the previous sentence. I assume that it takes up some of those same themes, and placed after that statement, it seems to suggest a shift in topics that is never spelled out. Finally: commas, yes!05 Oct 2018 5:09 pm: Frank Speizer
This is likely to be a heavy, intense, lit course, by an excellent SGL. However, I agree with the several commentators that this seems to be too much material for a 6 week course (two novels, 1 short story and a film).  When she says will send out pre-readings does she mean that the books should have been read before the course begins?  This will be off putting for some.  Should encourage to 12 weeks.   05 Oct 2018 10:16 pm: Linda Neumann
The two novels are over 700 pages together. Then another story and film?  Perhaps cut out the short story or expand the course duration. The sentence about Nostromo could mention the imaginary South American country.06 Oct 2018 10:18 pm: Penny Revelle
I agree that this sounds like too much for a 6 week course.  Ten weeks would be better if we had that option this spring.  Otherwise it would have to be 12 weeks.  If Mimi is wedded to the 6 week session maybe she would delete one of the novels or the short story and film?  It might help if Mimi could decide whether she is giving a course on Conrad in general (12 weeks) or how Conrad dealt with  some subset of  the subjects: identity, love, greed, passion, justice , and the isolation of the individual within the constraints of society.(6 weeks)07 Oct 2018 3:47 pm: Sara Freedman

Good rewrite, but i miss the nostromo quote. Secret sharer sentence is duhplicated.07 Oct 2018 4:37 pm: Addison Stone
Glad to see the extension to 10 weeks. Lots of editorial glitches in the CD, including a duplicated sentence, a run-on, etc. The attempt to bring The Secret Sharer more tightly into the central theme doesn’t quite work. Note that the wording of the opening sentence seems to suggest that Conrad wrote only 2 novels and 1 short story. Also, the novels are termed “political,” but the short story is not similarly characterized. I haven’t read The Secret Sharer, but I assume it too deals with political issues, so the sentence needs to read something like: “Joseph Conrad, one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, wrote two fascinating novels, Nostromo and The Secret Agent, and one short story, The Secret Sharer, that focus intensely on political issues.” Alternatively (since I don’t know Conrad’s overall output), it could be: ““Joseph Conrad, one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, focused in much of his work on political issues. In this SG, we will read two fascinating novels, Nostromo and The Secret Agent, and one short story, The Secret Sharer, that exemplify this focus.” 

Note that sentence 4 (which is repeated) doesn’t really say anything about The Secret Sharer that links it to the central theme. In the next sentence, “in” should presumably be “and.” Sentence 5 needs reworking to remove redundancy. Also, not clear why viewing the film is linked to “enquiring minds.” One minor point: Should the final sentence (about spirited dialogue) be omitted. Seems to just dangle there.
07 Oct 2018 5:43 pm: Mickey Zemon
The CD has certainly improved.  Following up on all of Addison's suggestions above will bring it over the finish line.

We need to discuss the extended time request.04 Oct 2018 8:32 am: Addison Stone
As described, this SG seems a little “light” (mostly viewing films, and only 1 hour of reading prep?). How much time will there be for discussion? How meaty will the readings be? Also, it seems odd to add in the “serious” film (first sentence of second paragraph), given the title and thrust of the first paragraph. A more apt superordinate theme/title or dropping/replacing the serious film would create a more cohesive package.04 Oct 2018 8:38 am: Barbara Burr
More than some of the film classes, this one seems to be well thought through and  focused.  I worry that 4 films in 6 wks is mostly watching and little time for discussing.  I don't know why the 2nd sentence starts with But.  I think she means that the reality doesn't always match the stereotype.  Can leave out the sentence about reading material and that would cut out works.  ""award winning"" should be hyphenated?  Bio: write out number three.  04 Oct 2018 9:32 am: Susan Harris
The CD is too long.  The course should include only comedic films or change the title.  Once I looked up ""superordinate"" I agreed with Addison's comment on creating a more cohesive package.  How long are the films?  It's hard to know how much time is available for discussion without knowing how much will be taken up with viewing.  I would like to see a list of the films in the proposal if not in the CD itself.04 Oct 2018 10:42 am: Mickey Zemon
I agree with Addison - 4 films in 6 weeks are at least 1 too many! Agree with Barbara about that second sentence that starts with But.  Could change it to: We will view view and discuss three films that reflect attitudes that have shaped Italy.
She needs to delete the first sentence of the second paragraph and merge the two paragraphs into one. Why do proposers think they can submit a CD that is more than one paragraph?  With that sentence deleted as well as the one about reading materials, the CD should be close to 150 words.
Of course, she needs to change the title so it no longer mentions tragic -- how about just Social Issues in Italian Comic Films
Why does she not assign a book on Italian film?   One hour prep time a week is scratching the bottom of the barrel. 
She should add in her bio that she has led several other study groups at HILR.  I think most of them have been on Italian film and they have been very popular and well received.
04 Oct 2018 4:24 pm: David Bliss
Three films should be sufficient to incite learning and to evoke discussion of the forces that drive Italy. It would be helpful for the committee to have a list of the three movies, and their time lengths.  Are they longer than 120 minutes?  In the past Carol has shown a movie during one session, followed by discussion during the next session.  In that case, a longer class period would not be required for every session.  SGLs should not assume that they can have an extra half hour every time.  04 Oct 2018 8:07 pm: Katherine O'Connor
Let me add to the chorus of grumbles about the second sentence beginning with ""But."" I agree with the concerns about class time being devoted to viewing more than to discussing if four films are to be shown. I feel confident, however, that Carol will address out concerns.  04 Oct 2018 10:20 pm: Helen Bakeman
Agree with the above comments about the proposal.  Although Carol has quite a good reputation as an SGL of courses on Italian literature and film, this one seems light05 Oct 2018 11:45 am: Sara Freedman
The ""but"" beginning the second sentence threw me off. Confused about whether these films reflect travelers' notions of Italy or those that have shaped Italians' understanding of their own country. Is she saying that this genre of film is particularly useful in understanding Italy? Why? I can't find the names and lengths of the various films, which would impact the amount of time available for discussion and the quality of the discussion as well. Is there an overarching question or focus that connects the four films together into a coherent whole?05 Oct 2018 5:20 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with much of above.  We certainly need titles, and length of films.  In one of her courses, which also had a book on the director that was discussed, the films were broken up and shown in two sessions, with a reasonable discussion of issues raised in the second half of the session on the film days.  Don't know if she is planning that for these comedic films.  (perhaps not if she is asking for 12:30).  Suggest more detail needs to be discussed, but of our panoply of film courses, hers have been some of the best.   05 Oct 2018 5:20 pm: Frank Speizer

I would assume she is starting at 12:30 to allow discussion time but that needs to be cleared up.  I agree that 4 films is too much for a 1/2 term course and that deleting the tragic film and changing the title would help fix that, but she could also delete one comic film and keep the tragic one and that would be a better balance of tragic/comic. and might be more what Carol has in mind for discussion.  Definitely need the film titles and the film lengths.09 Oct 2018 2:39 pm: Ron Ebert

Should be a good SG. Linda has a great style for fostering lively discussion that digs deeply into drama. The CD is nicely written but quite short, and I think more can be done to help prospective SGM’s appreciate why she chose the plays that she did. Note that the theme of “dreams” is present in lots of drama. Why these three plays? How will class time be used? Will she be screening all or parts of productions of these plays (as she did in an Ibsen SG that I took)?03 Oct 2018 11:38 am: Sara Freedman
Strong selection of plays, ones that many have read and/or seen performed over the years. Would like more discussion of the essence of the course, and agree with Addison that information about the structure of the course, whether there will be an screening of productions or class readings, etc. Perhaps open up the discussion of the ""dream,"" and what that means in the American context and how each of these plays comments on the others. 03 Oct 2018 2:00 pm: Mickey Zemon
These are three terrific plays, and Linda is truly a master study group leader.
It would be good to know if she is going to be showing scenes from these plays in class -- and mention of this would fill out the CD a little.  Another way to add to the CD is to point out that these plays were all written around the same time period but by three playwrights with very different styles, perspectives and objectives.
However, it really does not matter how long this CD is because Linda has an enormous following, and many people are going to sign up for this course.   Accept.03 Oct 2018 5:00 pm: Ron Ebert
I strongly feel the cd should be expanded. Ideas suggested above are fine, particularly why these plays, structure of class and yes, any scenes from the plays?03 Oct 2018 7:07 pm: Linda Neumann
Agree with Ron that this should be more informative.  What distinguishes each from the others?  How is the dream theme presented differently?  Screenings?  The basic information is clear and the course will probably fill, but the CD should present as much as possible within the limits.03 Oct 2018 7:35 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree with above comments.  The second sentence is a bit awkward, especially ""thematically present.""  Is the punctuation correct?  They are great plays for sure.04 Oct 2018 9:36 am: Susan Harris
The course sounds great but the CD is thin.  Beef it up along any one of the good ideas suggested above.  Since dreams are the thing that link these plays, it seems that dreams should figure in the title and/or lead sentence.04 Oct 2018 4:09 pm: David Bliss
Dreams are made or broken in these three plays. The characters all have dreams of something better. Although many members may know Linda already,  it would be helpful for new members for her to tell the motivation for choosing these three plays.  04 Oct 2018 7:18 pm: Jim Whitters
Agree with above comments that call for the CD to be expanded-----need to explain why these plays are worthy of being the subject matter of a course.04 Oct 2018 8:00 pm: Katherine O'Connor

Two hundred works by 75 artists from the Busch-Reisinger Museum collection are featured. The Bauhaus, closed in 1933 by the Nazis, became the most influential school of art, architecture, and design in the world. It did away with separation of craft from fine art.  Walter Gropius, founding director of the Bauhaus who joined Harvard’s Department of Architecture in 1937, gathered artists fleeing the Nazis and assembled their works in the Busch-Reisinger Museum. Included in the exhibit are Anni and Joseph Albers, Herbert Bayer, Lyonel Feininger, and László Moholy-Nagy. We will explore and discuss these works in an interactive format.  The class will be held at the Harvard Art Museums.","2","","Betty W.","","Stone","","bettyannstone@gmail.com","6174941931","3 or more","","","","","","","","","","Magdelena Droste|Bauhaus|TASCHEN|2015|x","||||","","","","<strong>Readings: </strong>This edition only: Magdelena Droste, <em>Bauhaus</em>&nbsp;(TASCHEN, 2015); , <em></em>&nbsp;(, ).","Estimated outside work is two hours per week.

This will be a popular art course and will certainly fill. It might be worthwhile mentioning that Harvard Art Museum's special exhibition is in honor of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Bauhaus school.  Will there be days when the class will meet at the Museum?  Or is it mostly available to see on line?  The very long sentence could be divided into two.  Also, it would be better to use active verb rather than a passive one.  Could say ""we will have access to the archives...""  if that is true.02 Oct 2018 8:29 pm: Ron Ebert
Nice idea to match this to the exhibit. Betty told me the course will take place at the museum- this should be spelled out. Edit out the three “We will....”  otherwise, it is good. Accept02 Oct 2018 8:58 pm: Linda Neumann
Betty’s courses are always in demand.  Definitely should say that course sessions are at the museum.  Agree to break up long, awkward sentence and clean up some punctuation.  Good comment by David to add 100th.  Accept03 Oct 2018 8:27 am: Addison Stone
A great idea for an SG that capitalizes on a special opportunity. I would personally like to see the addition of a book on the Bauhaus, especially if the SG time will be largely devoted to viewing exhibits. How will SGM's get the ""big picture""? If the class sessions will take place in the museum, that should definitely be stated, along with some indication of how the time in the museum will be used (mini-lectures in front of exhibits?; discussion in a museum seminar room?).

Seems like sentences 1 and 3 should be combined and placed up front. Something like, “The Bauhaus, the school of art and design founded in Germany in 1919 and shut down by the Nazis in 1933, was the site of the creative experiments in the visual arts that have profoundly shaped the world today. It brought together artists, architects and designers. We will explore their works in historical context.”

Need a comma after “design” in the next to last sentence. In the bio, “she has lead” should be “she has led.”03 Oct 2018 9:37 am: Helen Bakeman
Great idea for a SG and wonderful timing.  Agree with Addison re: combining first and third sentences.  When I read the  CD, I get a good sense of “who” but a less good sense of “what.” Could there be a sentence that describes the Bauhaus style or its approach to creativity.03 Oct 2018 11:34 am: Sara Freedman
Great idea for course, especially as it will be held at the museum and will focus on the special exhibit there. Agree this needs to be spelled out, not only because it is a plus but also because people need to know the transportation issues involved. Would like more discussion of what makes the Bauhaus school special, what was its essence and why that school was so influential during its time and continuing. Why was it shut down by the Nazis, for example? 03 Oct 2018 7:25 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree with all the above comments, especially clarifying  the venue and structure of the course, and a quick description of what is meant by Bauhaus.  This might be more useful than the long list of artists.  A concise reference  book if such exists would be a plus.  The next to last sentence is way too long.  Bio: should 8 be spelled out? Or both 8 and 11?03 Oct 2018 9:12 pm: Penny Revelle
Agree that the course taking place at the museum is vital to include in the CD. 
 I love the long list of Bauhausers but it could be shortened if some of the other suggestions were implemented, such as including more about why the Bauhaus school was important in the evolution of modern art.04 Oct 2018 8:44 am: Susan Harris
I agree that the venue must be indicated and that a brief overview text would be helpful if available.  I agree that many of the edits suggested above would improve the proposal but, aside from the spelling and punctuation edits, don't consider them mandatory.  I would especially like to see a description of what characterized the Bauhaus school -- we learn when it was founded and ended but not much else.  04 Oct 2018 7:54 pm: Katherine O'Connor
I agree with Addison's comment. I too wanted a little more info about what is signified by the Bauhaus. The listing of a lot of names associated with it doesn't illuminate what its distinguishing characteristics were. Listing the venue is obviously important given that that seems to be an important part of offering's appeal.05 Oct 2018 5:35 pm: Frank Speizer
Little more to add.  Need to indicate course at museum, and perhaps substituting a statement on Bauhaus School, rather than a list of names, which will obviously come up in the course.  Agree a book would also be useful.  07 Oct 2018 8:34 pm: Mickey Zemon

Nice improvements. Seems fine as is, but if want to shorten the CD, I agree with Sara that it’s the last sentence should be shortened.12 Oct 2018 9:43 am: Linda Neumann
Nice revision.  Agree that you can cut out the locations of the class meetings, just note that they will be in the museum.  Perhaps add of ""works of"" before the listing of artists Anni and Joseph., etc.   Question:  the Bauhaus became the most influential school...  Is it implied that this happened before it closing in 1933 or after?12 Oct 2018 9:59 am: Barbara Burr
Agree with above comments.12 Oct 2018 10:02 am: David Bliss
Excellent re-working of the proposal.  The implication is that Bauhaus  ""became the most influential school of art, architecture, and design in the world"" and continued to be even after the Nazi closure. I assume that is correct.

Another great proposal for a study group.  
The CD is very short.  Why not add some enticing questions about some of the pieces that will be studied?  At the moment it sounds like the classes are all about  listening to music and lectures. Also add to CD where and how  discussions fit into the picture.
Second sentence: twenty-year old not 20-year-old

I have taken and enjoyed Fred's Chopin course, but that said, what Mickey says the course ""sounds like"" in her second sentence is right on target.  Quite a bit of personal info about the composer plus a lot of wonderful listening but not much musicological info about what we were listening to. I didn't care because listening to Chopin was enough for me, but I think it might be disappointing to the more musically sophisticated. There are, however, others like me who don't mind sitting and basking in wonderful sound. Accept.02 Oct 2018 12:46 pm: Barbara Burr
Sounds delightful, even if light on music theory etc. Accept02 Oct 2018 2:42 pm: Sara Freedman
I too have taken several of these courses and I have enjoyed them thoroughly. I also agree with Katherine that Fred should be encouraged to include more musicological information, making sure that it is accessible to all in the class. I think that if done well, the course can be a joy to all, musicians and non musicians alike.02 Oct 2018 5:31 pm: David Bliss
Some people (Jennifer Huntington for example) have objected to the way Fred's courses are run.  There is very little SGM input other than listening .  This is clear from the description : the word discussion does not appear.  It would be nice if he could include class discussion of the book about Brahms' life, or about the musical innovations that Brahms made.  On the other hand, there should not be any false advertising if in fact, no discussion is expected.02 Oct 2018 9:12 pm: Linda Neumann
I have taken  a couple of Virginia Newes music courses which are rich in listening, musicology and biography but light in discussion.  They are a delight.  But if Fred has a different style and has enthusiastic class members - fine.  The CD seems to reflect this.  Also we have few music classes.  Go03 Oct 2018 8:12 am: Addison Stone
Definitely an Accept, but I agree with above comments about the need to be clear regarding content. I'd love to see discussion of the musical structure, and of the biographical events, etc., but if that isn't to be, then perhaps the content of the CD is accurate as it is. 

What role will the book actually play? How about inserting some mention of its role, in, for example, the sentence beginning, “Through live performances by the SGL…” This sentence could begin, “Through discussion of material in Jan Swafford’s acclaimed biography, live performances by the SGL….” 

Sentence 5 (“Through live performance….”) is quite long and a bit awkward. Suggest breading it into two sentences. Commas needed after “composer” in sentence 4, and after “guests” in sentence 5.

In the bio, I suggest cutting back a bit on Fred’s background and inserting instead something about his past SG’s.

Agree that Fred use some of the additional words available to him to outline some of the musical innovations and highlights of Brahms’ work. Agree with Addison about the bio03 Oct 2018 9:06 pm: Penny Revelle
I have taken several of Fred's courses and enjoyed them just as they were -  discussion was not promoted although questions were encouraged.   There was some musicology - sometimes offered by SGM's.  If Fred was open to the idea of more discussion and/or musicology I wonder if he wouldn't enjoy giving out some questions ahead of time that could then be discussed?04 Oct 2018 8:59 am: Susan Harris
I agree with Mickey's edits except for the numbers (20-year-old and 19th century) which seem to me to be consistent with our style sheet.  I agree that Fred should leave out mention of the guest who will ""hopefully"" come.  Finally, I am fine with Fred doing a lecture/listening class if that's what he wants to do.  Accept.05 Oct 2018 5:42 pm: Frank Speizer
Fred is a treasure and we should encourage him to do his thing.  His thing is to thematically bring classical music to us in a way that enhances appreciation.  Clearly it is not a discussion course, the CD indicates that and that's ok.  ACCEPT10 Oct 2018 4:50 pm: Fred Chanania

This is a shift for Gene, who is a wonderful science instructor. He might appreciate the offer of a little help in structuring a history discussion course. The CD is much too long. Because he is associated with science mostly-lecture courses, I’d like to see something in the bio that describes his interest in this topic. Please suggest to Gene that he can help to avoid a schedule that conflicts with his course choices by checking with their SGLs and choosing different times in his preferences. With work on the CD and bio, this is a “go.""30 Sep 2018 8:46 pm: Linda Neumann
I concur with Dick that Gene has led outstanding science courses. And he certainly has participated in many discussion courses at HILR.  I expect that he can lead a good discussion.  He could remove the sentences about the duplicity among the members and the sentence about additional materials that he will supply without taking away from his main points.  After some editing, accept.30 Sep 2018 9:12 pm: Mickey Zemon
I don't want to lead a study group the same time that Gene is giving this one so I will be free to take his course!   
Second sentence: change World-wide to world-wide
Next to last sentence: change Kim Philiby to Kim Philby
Other required materials: ""A Spy Named Orphan , Roland Philips.  If this is a book, delete the quotation mark before A Spy; after Orphan delete comma and add by Roland Philips.
To eliminate over 4o words: delete There is a large body of literature on this topic, but many questions remain unanswered.  Also delete the last two sentences -- if 60-80 pages of reading should be 3 hours prep time in the Workload section of the proposal.
Gene has led at least one study group on John Le Carré's novels in the past.  He might want to mention this in his bio. Although I did not take that course, I heard it was terrific.  30 Sep 2018 9:51 pm: Barbara Burr

I agree the 4th and the last two sentence s can be cut.
Should the book listed in other required materials go into the book section with a note that the SGL will provide sections to be read on the course site?
Then part of the second to last sentence --""The SGL will provide other relevant material.""  could go into the other required materials section (with maybe a hint of what that would be.)

194 words—I think that the 2nd and 3rd sentences could be deleted, or combined into a shorter sentence.  I think that the 4th sentence with revisions is important—something like “while much is known about how this group operated, many’s questions remain unanswered. If he says the number of hours (3), should number off pages be delete? In second do last sentence, Ring should not have a capital R. He says that there will be two books but only one is listed—where is other one?  Or is that what is listed in handouts?  Not clear.  Agree that study group on LeCarre novel should be added to bio01 Oct 2018 1:29 pm: David Bliss
I suppose this must be an exception to our style sheet.  Both the title and the first line contain the cardinal number 5 instead of five.  OK, this time I can let it go. There is confusion about the second book. It is written by Roland Phillips, not by a Russian KGB agent.  The Bio should name his interest in the field of spy novels.01 Oct 2018 5:05 pm: Katherine O'Connor

Agree that this is an intriguing topic. Adding mention of previous SG on Le Carre in the Bio should address the concern re a switch of topics. Suggested deletions and edits should fix the CD.

[Workflow note] Edits based upon further description of course from the SGL have been made and now ready for further discussion.03 Oct 2018 8:36 am: Addison Stone
The book mystery has just gotten more mysterious for me. The CD still says that there will be two books, one of which is written by the KGB handler, but the newly added second book is not that book. Instead, the KGB book is now listed under Other Required Materials. So, are there three books? Need to reconcile.

Various earlier suggestions for shortening the still apparently untouched CD need to be implemented.

This sounds like a wonderful course and the CD, though ridiculously over the word limit, is very compelling.  Agree with various suggestions above for shortening.  In addition to Mickey's edits, I would de-capitalize ""Gentlemen"" in the first sentence.  I could see ""Cambridge 5"" as an exception to the style rule for numbers if that were how the group is normally referred to, but ""Cambridge Five"" seemed more common in my quick perusal of web sites.

Today’s stories by Irish writers reflect the changing social, political, and personal landscape of this small island nation that has produced a remarkable number of great writers. Many of us are familiar with the short stories of James Joyce and William Trevor, but there are many more Irish short story writers who should be read and appreciated. This study group will explore short stories from the last half of the 20th century to the present by contemporary authors, such as Mary Lavin, Dermot Bolger, Ann Enright, John McGahern, Claire Keegan, and many more.

I think this can be a good course.  I wonder if the 2 hour preparation estimate is right. Since Eileen is a long-time member, but has only taught one course previously, I suggest a little conversation about the structure of the course. She names 5 stories and says there are others, plus what I take to be an essay by Frank O’Connor (not to be included in the catalog listing). Is it one story a week, or more than that?  The proposal also needs a lot of little edits, which I’m sure Helen can take care of without my detailing them. 30 Sep 2018 8:47 pm: Mickey Zemon
I agree with Dick.  Cannot resist a few little edits below:
Second sentence: story-telling history, the quotation marks around tale need to be fixed.
Third sentence: space before first word Most
Fourth sentence: Masters of the Short Story - why upper case letters?  If caps are from Enright then perhaps these words should be between quotation marks.
Fifth sentence: including stories - change to including those since stories mentioned earlier in sentence
Last line: their (not your) reaction to (to is missing)30 Sep 2018 9:05 pm: Linda Neumann
Aside from the ""little edits"", the CD is clear and should attract a good audience.  She notes that she would like some advice on how many stories to assign per week.   Who should advise?  Is it the TLC?30 Sep 2018 9:39 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree with edits.  Is there some way tO characterize what makes Irish short stories disrinctive?   A good topic.30 Sep 2018 9:56 pm: Ron Ebert
Nice idea for course- with edits, accept. Hellen might be able to begin a  discussion of  the structure of the course and number of stories and refer her to teaching and learning for more assistance.30 Sep 2018 10:10 pm: Penny Revelle
Good topic and enticing study group.  Just to make it a little more enticing I would rework the second to last sentence so it is doesn't sound so forbiddingly schoolmarmish.  Maybe: ""SGMs will read the stories closely and then have a chance during the SG to discuss and criticize them.""
As for how many stories per week I would think it depends on their length.  If the workload is two hours per week that might translate into 60-80 pages per week and then however many stories fit into that many pages.
Take out the partial sentence at the end: ""Reading about 50-60 per week.""01 Oct 2018 12:01 pm: David Bliss
I like the format of the class.  But there are two titles.  One of them would suffice;  I prefer the second one. She probably plans to do more than one story per class, so a two-hour reading assignment would cover that.01 Oct 2018 2:29 pm: Jim Whitters
Attractive course. Clarification needed regarding reading per week in terms of stories and/or pages.01 Oct 2018 5:28 pm: Katherine O'Connor
I agree that two course titles are not needed, and I would opt for the second choice. Agree with Mickey's edits. There are a lot of great Irish short stories, and the Frank O'Connor book is excellent for any course on the short story. I think that the CD should give some more specific indication as to why the stories of these particular Irish authors are great. Accept with edits.01 Oct 2018 6:28 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with much of above.  One title is sufficient.  Other edits as suggested.  It is not clear to me whether we need to give estimated pages a week or just homework time.  In this case might be better to say 2-3 stories/week and 3 hour prep, rather than 6080 pages. ACCEPT with edits. 02 Oct 2018 8:40 am: Addison Stone
Seems like a good focus for an SG, but I agree with others about the need to pick only one title. The second seems better. The CD seems generally fine, though it seems a bit odd to emphasize the shift to English in the mid 19th C and then announce without explanation that the SG will focus on the late 20th C. Either eliminate the specific reference to 19th C and/or say something about decision to focus on recent stories? I also wonder about singling out the novella in the final sentence. I would cut that and use the words to address my preceding comment. Some possible edits: In the second sentence, hyphenate “story telling.” Also, that same sentence might read better if the second clause were marked more explicitly. So, “…long and robust, and it gave rise….” I would not capitalize “Masters of the Short Story.” Need a comma before “and others” in third sentence from the end. Finally, in the next to last sentence, the juxtaposition of the singular “reaction” and plural “criticisms” is a bit awkward. What about simple “your reactions to each story.”02 Oct 2018 2:47 pm: Sara Freedman
Members seem to be attracted to Irish literature, for good reason. I agree with the suggestions above - use only the second title, make the grammatical and stylistic changes, and perhaps give some sense of why this literature is distinctive and enticing. Right now, CD reads a little bland.04 Oct 2018 12:48 pm: Susan Harris
I like Penny's revision of the second to last sentence.  It was both grammatically incorrect (the missing ""to"") and boring.  I agree with Mickey's edits.  I prefer the second title.  Accept with edits.13 Oct 2018 1:02 pm: Helen Bakeman

I’m sure this will be an excellent course. The CD is much too long, and a bit rambling. It needs italics for book titles. With a tighter and more focused CD, accept.30 Sep 2018 8:30 pm: Mickey Zemon
This sounds like a terrific study group.  The questions is how to trim it down by about 47 words.
I suggest eliminating two sentences.  The first is: We all have to deal with death and loss, perhaps more immediately as we get older.  The second is the final sentence: I had a wonderful time leading the two prior Study Groups on Spring Snow, and am very much looking forward to the chance to continue the discussions with Part 2 of Mishima's tetralogy.  This brings the word count very close to 150 without eliminating the essence of this very excellent CD.30 Sep 2018 9:07 pm: Linda Neumann

Fascinating and chilling, given author’s suicide to note the completion of his work. Perhaps drop “we can be grateful” sentence, also.30 Sep 2018 10:00 pm: Penny Revelle
Sounds like an excellent study group.  I would drop the last two sentences rather than the 5th and last and then add to the bio:   He has led several SGs on Japanese literature and looks forward to continuing with Part 2 of Mishima's tetrology.01 Oct 2018 11:43 am: David Bliss
Fascinating topic, although I do not understand the word ""touching"" in the title.  Does it mean ""understanding""? Also, I think the cycle of four novels should be lower case. The title is The Sea of Fertility and it should be italicised.01 Oct 2018 1:14 pm: Helen Bakeman

I assume that someone will check on how the preceding SG's were received. Assuming no issues there, I think this is a ""go"" once the CD is shortened/tightened. I agree with Mickey's and Ron's suggested deletions as well as Penny's suggested alternative final sentence for the bio. David's suggested edits also important.01 Oct 2018 7:47 pm: Katherine O'Connor
I agree with Ron's choice of adjectives regarding the topic - ""fascinating and chilling."" I also agree that the ""we can be grateful"" sentence could be dropped. With shortening, the CD is ready to go.04 Oct 2018 1:13 pm: Susan Harris
Great idea, compelling proposal.  I agree that any of the three suggested sentences can be eliminated to shorten the CD (""Death and loss..."", ""We can all be grateful..."", and ""I had a wonderful time..."").  I would probably take out the first because it's obvious and the third because it's too informal and includes language that could be moved to the bio.   I understand David's reaction to ""Touching the Mind..."" in the title, but if the preceding course's title began that way it makes sense to begin this Part 2 course in the same way.

Agree that this is a compelling topic, and that the CD is nicely constructed to convey the issue and spark interest. I wonder, however, if they are biting off a bit too much for a 6-week SG. Should they cut back on the number of topics/areas to be covered? I see that their list of topics aligns with the book chapters, which are short, so maybe okay, but I worry a bit about superficiality. The third sentence needs a comma after ""today,"" and the last sentence needs a comma after ""hours."" I like comma's, so I would also put one after ""Marshall"" in the penultimate sentence.30 Sep 2018 9:42 am: Barbara Burr
A fine topic.  Don't need the last sentence, so with some extra word allowance, I would make the 3rd sentence a bit more specific as opposed to vague general statements (eg how ""modern technology may be affecting the future"" - it obviously is, so how does this relate to geopolitical issues...).  Also, at some point I would refer to the full title of the book: Prisoners of Geography: Ten Maps That Explain Everything About The World.  Reviews I read were middling.30 Sep 2018 11:29 am: David Bliss
This course would appeal to geopolitics junkies if there are any.  After the first series of questions, it might be to suggest an answer: ""They might be prisoners of their geographical location"".  The CD should make clear that the book title is about the world maps, and it is a New York Times best-seller.30 Sep 2018 3:17 pm: Jim Whitters
the first time that I read the CD I thought it was much too much for a 6 week course but upon re-reading it I found it to be a topic that does cover much ground but very doable as I understand the SGL's further discussion in the ""Further information"" section. Accept 30 Sep 2018 6:25 pm: Sara Freedman
Good course description with thoughtful accompanying questions. It does seem to be a topic worthy of a full semester. I'm wondering if they would consider adding an additional book that would more time and perhaps a different perspective on the topic.30 Sep 2018 8:57 pm: Linda Neumann
An engaging and different topic.  Agree with above that the material could easily be a full term or 10 week course. Perhaps they would be willing to extend the course.  Tibet is not a ""tiny"" country.30 Sep 2018 9:48 pm: Ron Ebert
I like david’s suggestion adding sentence to clarify their goal. It does seem as if it might be a full semester course, otherwise they might seem to be rushing through their meaty topics.01 Oct 2018 1:21 pm: Helen Bakeman
Good idea for a course.  Neither of the last 2 sentences is necessary—they repeat information that is given elsewhere.  That gives them additional space to raise other issues that will be discussed in class such as goals, most critical 21st century geopolitical issues.  Agree that they should be encouraged to extend to 10 weeks.01 Oct 2018 7:54 pm: Katherine O'Connor

We would watch Live and Become in that session, or perhaps split across the second and third sessions (slightly longer than 2 hours). The third session would involve discussion of the readings and film. In session 4, I would show Walk on Water, with discussion in week 5. Readings for that film related to memories of the Holocaust. In week 6, we would watch and discuss Sand Storm, with discussion continuing in week 7. Week 8 would be devoted to the integration of indigenous communities (Bedouins, Druze, Christians) into Israeli society.

I think this would be a very appealing and thought-provoking study group.
If the 6th session is going to deal with the immigration in the 90s of the Jews from the Former USSR (see Further Information above) then perhaps she needs to add a fourth question something like: How did the immigration of the Jews from the former USSR in the 1990s differ from the experience of other immigrant groups?  I do not know if Former or former USSR is correct.
I suggest not putting the names of the films in parenthesis after the questions.  Instead I would include them in the last sentence with a rewrite that goes something like this: We will gain insights into these issues by viewing three films -- Live and Become, Walk on Water, and Sand Storm, reading sections of  Start Up Nation and other selected sources, and listening to guest lecturers.  Our discussions will focus on understanding the trials and tribulations of those coming (add ""to"") and those within the nation of Israel.  I would eliminate: and so can we gain greater insight to struggles of peoples in our larger world.
She needs to trim the bio.29 Sep 2018 4:21 pm: Sara Freedman
I agree that the topic is appealing and could elicit a thought provoking study group. I particularly like Sand Storm as it deals with issues that are central to many Israelis today, and are widely discussed and debated within the general population.
I have a  number of questions/comments:
I believe it is important to include the laws of Israel concerning immigration: The Law of the Return and more very recent Law on the Jewish Nation. Without this legal and historical background, it is hard to understand Israel's stance on immigration. 
I am not sure how Live and Become is central to the core issues of immigration and identity within Israel. It seems to be a thoughtful film on an important topic, but not one in which immigration or identity are central.
There are films about African migrants to Israel, whose fate as aliens within the culture is quite bleak and contested. Could they be considered for such a course? Many in Israel see their situation as emblematic of the major contradictions within Israel about immigration - shunning Africans while embracing Russians, many of whom are not Jews but do bolster the white, highly educated population in Israel. 
29 Sep 2018 4:22 pm: Penny Revelle
Great ideas but I think it needs a serious rewrite.  There needs to be a first sentence explaining that 3 films  a book and a variety of materials posted on the website will be use to explore how immigrants, descendants of immigrants and indigenous peoples ---  well I'm not sure how to finish this sentence because I'm to sure there is an overriding goal stated in this course proposal.  The SGL needs to think about what she wants to explore - how immigrants and indigenous peoples integrate into Israeli society, what special angst do descendants of Nazi's suffer or something else.  It's too all-over-the-place right now.  Maybe she wants to look at the diversity of Israeli citizens and how they are going to get along to run the country.  If so she needs to have something on the Palestinians in there, but then it should be a 12 week course.
If she wants to remain within a 6 week time frame, I suggest she use only one or at most two of the films suggested.
Also she'll seriously decrease her target audience if she only wants people who have knowledge of Israeli history and  current politics - but maybe that's the intention.  Another way to go would be to have some class and reading time devoted to, at least, current politics if not history.29 Sep 2018 10:03 pm: Frank Speizer
I agree fully with Penny. Need get the idea that this is a short film course in first sentence and also agree that cannot limit Course to those with working knowledge of Israeli immigration. Thematic questions of what this course will cove also needs to be included. Suggest discuss and full re-write30 Sep 2018 6:42 am: Barbara Burr
Agree with Penny.  Seems overly inclusive for 6wks.  Required reading can say there will be articles provided on a variety of  retopics30 Sep 2018 6:47 am: Barbara Burr
(Sorry above got posted too soon!) ...a variety of relevant topics. Needs sharper focus re most important themes. Bio a problem.30 Sep 2018 11:06 am: David Bliss
Very interesting topic.  But the CD needs to explain the format of the course.  Starting with a poignant question is a good idea, but the next series of questions does not give information about how the course will be run.  The Bio is way too long.  It should be focused on what she has done relative to the course content. Has she led discussions on these films before?30 Sep 2018 12:44 pm: Jim Whitters
I concur with Barbara-----very compelling topic that should result in a superb course----overall the CD needs to be harnessed so that there is more clarity for those who are contemplating taking the course.30 Sep 2018 9:35 pm: Linda Neumann
 The topic is fascinating and the Israeli population probably experiences more religious, ethnic, generational, racial,  economic, political, and assimilation issues per capita than any country in the world.  

Agree with Penny that this needs to be rewritten.  First of all, to tell us that it is a film course and not include the film titles in parenthesis.  Perhaps add that she will be providing some background material (on immigration, Bedouins) in order to understand the context of the films.  She should not assume that interested members are familiar with the situation in Israel.

Agree with Sara that two of the major conflicts involve the historical power of the  European Jews  and the immigration of over 1 million Jews (and non Jews) from the USSR and subsequent republics since the 1970's.  However, she has chosen other topics and  in  six weeks she can't cover everything.

Bio needs serious pruning.30 Sep 2018 9:41 pm: Ron Ebert
Well, all has been said and i concurr with rewrite. Also 3 films, one book and nineteen required articles AND a speaker in six weeks? Some more thought needs to be given to how all of this will fit together. Yes bio needs rewrite and degrees should be dropped.01 Oct 2018 1:30 pm: Helen Bakeman
Great idea for a study group and needs major rewrite work on CD and Bio.  I agree with Penny’s comments, and also Sarah suggestion of setting this within the standards set by Israeli law01 Oct 2018 8:14 pm: Katherine O'Connor
The CD is too diffuse. I agree that if films and materials about immigration and integration are the focus of the course then Sara's suggestion about including the relevant Israeli laws is important; however, the films selected seem not to have this specific focus. Given Barbara's familiarity with Israeli films, maybe she should consider giving a course on what she considers to be the greatest recent Israeli films and why.16 Oct 2018 9:14 am: Susan Harris
Sorry - missed this one earlier.  Nice course idea.  I agree with all the above, especially the need for a clearer focus.  The closest we have to an overall objective is to ""understand the trials and tribulations of those coming and those within the nation of Israel"".  This is very vague.  CD should be expanded and tightened up.  20 Oct 2018 8:15 am: Addison Stone
[Workflow note] This revision responds to many of the concerns/suggestions raised. The CD has been rewritten, as has the Bio. The required book has been eliminated since only 2 or 3 chapters would be relevant. The SGL resisted the suggestion to incorporate a book on Israeli history or politics, so the CD now indicates that some background is presupposed. A relevant book will be posted on the website for those who want to do advanced preparation.20 Oct 2018 8:19 am: Addison Stone
[Workflow note] This revision addresses many of the concerns/suggestions provided by CC folks. The CD has been rewritten to clarify the role of the films and other materials. New Bio. The SGL resisted the suggestion to incorporate material on the history and politics of Israel, so a sentence has been added to the CD indicating that familiarity with these issues will be presumed. A book providing relevant background info will be listed on the course website. See Additional Info for Committee for the book title, as well as a brief plan for the 6 sessions.20 Oct 2018 9:33 am: Mickey Zemon
Excellent revision.
I am confused about the book.  Start Up Nation is mentioned in the CD  so one would assume that is the book for the course.  It should be in italics not quotes.  However, it is not listed below the CD on books for the course. The last sentence of the CD says a book will be posted on the course website. To post an entire book on a course website sounds like a violation of copyright. Where is the title of that book?
Accept, with clarification about the book.20 Oct 2018 10:01 am: Barbara Burr
Agree with Mikey re book confusion.  Good rewrite.20 Oct 2018 10:34 am: David Bliss
Very much better than the original.  Need a comma after accommodate.  Movies and book titles should be in italics.  If ""Start up Nation"" is the book to be posted on the website, then the last sentence should be ""The book...""20 Oct 2018 11:47 am: Helen Bakeman
Much clearer. Also a comma after exile. Second sentence—the word “different” should be deleted since it is really redundant..change to “the majority culture”. Third to last sentence—I am wondering if we can find better words than “trials and tribulations” which seem a bit trite and biblical, although that may be the point (try some of “difficulties,” “suffering,” ). 
Second to last sentence—maybe be explicit that SGL will assume “that SGMs have” basic knowledge...that’s what she means, right? Really???20 Oct 2018 4:50 pm: Frank Speizer
Well better, but I am concerned that basic knowledge of Israel won't work.  The book: Ari Shavit: My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel, seems like an excellent resource.  It is relatively cheap (&lt;$15), although 380 pages. To offer it as background and not use it seems inappropriate as most won&#039;t read it.    Using 3/6 weeks for films in class, seems excessive.  Why not push for 10 weeks with some time spent on the history with a required text?  20 Oct 2018 5:42 pm: Sara Freedman
Much, much better. Agree with problems relating to books. It is also not clear what ""basic knowledge"" means in this context, leader should assume that either a book, perhaps the one she notes, should be used or that she will have to provide some of this knowledge. Would like more information on other reading materials she will provide as that not clear in CD. Lots of time spent in course watching films, need to make sure that adequate time is provided for discussion, as there is sure to be a lot of discussion stirred up by the subject itself and the films.20 Oct 2018 6:48 pm: Linda Neumann
Still some confusion about the books.  Start Up Nation will not provide the desired background about history and current political situation that she wants.  It is not a required book, so will she have a course pack with those selections?  And what is the book for the background material?  Why not require some background reading and have a course pack? 

Good revision. 22 Oct 2018 4:33 pm: Ron Ebert
Very good rewrite. I too am confused about Start up Nation and the mysterious book on the website. Might make sense to leave out start up nation and change sente22 Oct 2018 4:35 pm: Ron Ebert
Oops- to finish my thought: combine last two sentences to clarify that the book will enable members to achieve the necessary “basic Knowledge about Israel”23 Oct 2018 5:02 pm: Addison Stone
[Workflow note] This proposal has undergone another round of significant revision. Most importantly, the format has been expanded to 10 weeks. Doing so, however, has led to a change in requested days. Because of Barbara’s travel schedule, she can offer the SG only on Mondays, with a strong preference for the afternoon. If Monday is not possible, Barbara would want to defer until Fall. Note that I could not delete the original information about scheduling (Additional Schedule Info and Time Preference Summary), so ignore. The core of the SG still revolves around showing and discussing the three films, but now there is more time for reading and discussing related print materials. In addition, relevant historical, cultural, and political contextual information will be introduced in the first session readings and discussion, rather than being presumed.23 Oct 2018 5:22 pm: David Bliss

Excellent topic, engagingly presented.  Punctuation, sentence structure and capitalization are all tres mal.  And too wordy.  I am curious what the book will add... 01 Oct 2018 12:30 pm: Linda Neumann
Could be a good course.  As Barbara said, needs careful editing to clean up random issues.  He could take out the sentence about Napoleon as a caricature - it would read more smoothly and the point is not necessary.
Change the bit about reading being ""encouraged.""  The book is required.
It seems to be mostly a lecture course - perhaps indicate 50-50 lecture, discussion is that is so.
I would take out the real estate developer part of bio.01 Oct 2018 1:44 pm: Helen Bakeman
Great topic but I end up not being at all clear exactly what he wants to cover and how. He wants to cover NB’s full bio and history of Europe with a focus on war.  Is Bonaparte symbolic/representative of what happened in Europe? Caused it? It also sounds a bit like SGMs should read the book (248 pages in 12 weeks and nothing else in particular) and then sit back and watch the slide show and listen, I am perhaps overstating this but that is what it sounds like.  I think that there needs to be an up-front conversation with Willy about these issues and then some rewriting. Has he done other study groups and, if so, how were they received?01 Oct 2018 1:49 pm: Ron Ebert
Perhaps start with the sentence “Most Americans have heard of Napoleon...” and when were the royal houses trying to prevent democratic ideas spreading? With some of the edits suggested above and shortening, should be fine. Willy tends to show slides and lecture. He might benefit from some assistance encouraging discussion.01 Oct 2018 2:19 pm: Mickey Zemon
I agree with Helen about not being clear about what he wants to cover and how.  I found his best explanation of this expressed in the Further information section: The purpose of the course is to understand the end of royal rule, the beginnings of democracy in Europe, and why war seems to be a necessity of civilization which continues today.  I would add as the first purpose ""to understand the rise and fall of Bonaparte."" I suggest deleting the last two sentences in the CD and replacing them with this one.  Another sentence that could be deleted is: Most Americans have heard of Napoleon, but in the USA he is mostly a caricature. Also: Napoleon did meet his Waterloo at Waterloo, but his history is poorly known.  Also: the one about most Americans that Ron mentions above.This should trim the CD down to about 150 words.
Need a clearer statement about what ""a visual presentation course with discussion and reading encouraged"" means.
First sentence: Napoleon with  u/c N; Anglo-American demon or French hero
Second sentence:  start this sentence and others with u/c letter; monarchy -- or was he both?  delete the semi-colon
Fifth sentence: troubled; a story of victories and defeats -- change to troubled and full of victories and defeats.
Other required materials: delete Group members may use other books or any other helpful information including the internet, but no additional materials will be required.


01 Oct 2018 2:21 pm: Jim Whitters
The subject should make for an interesting course. However, the CD needs to be reorganized so that the SGL is clear as to what direction he wants to take the course. I recommend a complete re-write for he sake of clarification and focus.01 Oct 2018 5:29 pm: Addison Stone
I think I just lost all of my comments, so I'll start again. Apologies if this is a duplication. I agree with others re the need to rework this CD. Some re-ordering of sentences and deleting of extraneous comments. Also, I agree re need to add caps and commas to what remains. It sounds like this is basically a lecture course with rich visual supports. So, what is the role of the book? Also, the book is over 50 years old (originally published in 1963), and there are more recent biographies that have received praise, so why this one? Finally, like Helen, I wonder about how the SGL will move from the narrow focus on Napoleon to the MUCH broader topic of the role of war in human history. If the latter is really going to be a significant part of the SG, shouldn't there be some readings on that broader topic?01 Oct 2018 8:24 pm: Katherine O'Connor
The CD really needs to be worked over and put in clearer focus. I didn't know that Napoleon was viewed as a demon by Americans. It was hard for me to read this CD without thinking of the Russian view of him as a kind of anti-Christ. Also, War and Peace is, among other things, a diatribe against Napoleon. I can't believe he was more of a demon to us than he was to the Russians, but I may be flaunting my ignorance here! 02 Oct 2018 2:54 pm: Sara Freedman
CD seems somewhat wandering. Not sure if a focus on Napoleon and his historical impact can be easily included in a discussion of the role of war in the making of history. Would like clarity on the integration of the two. Will Napoleon's history be a case study of something about history? If so, what?

Also, agree that book is very old. There are more recent and highly regarded biographies. Why not use one of these in a 12 week course, and make sure the course discusses this reading?

Needs more description of what he means by ""visual course."" Are we sitting back and looking at pictures while the SGL lectures?03 Oct 2018 2:01 pm: Susan Harris
I agree with Linda that this could be a good course, and I also agree with Jim that the proposal needs a complete rewrite after a few things have been decided:  
-What is the primary purpose of the course - to understand Napoleon or to understand why humans go to war?  It sounds like he wants to do both but the latter topic is a very big one and there is no indication of how it will be approached.  
-Is this the best book and how will it (or another) be integrated into the course?
And one minor comment -- to me a British demon is a demon who was born in Britain, not someone the British consider a demon.05 Oct 2018 6:22 pm: Frank Speizer
I agree with Helen and even before consider re-write of CD need a discussion about what this course is.  Although the word discussion does appear in the CD it really sounds like it is designed as a lecture course with slides.  The topic, I agree could be fascinating, but it could also be a very dull history lecture course of battle to battle.  David has his work cut out.  08 Oct 2018 9:29 am: Penny Revelle
I think a course focusing on Napoleon is an excellent idea, but to get into why people fight wars is a whole other topic and would deserve a course of its own, so I would leave out ""-----and at the necessity or insanity of war. the course will also discuss and examine why people who do not know and have no personal conflicts with each other, are willing to kill each other in battle.""
I wouldn't recommend this course for the lecture room on the 2nd floor - it needs discussion and that room doesn't stimulate discussion.14 Oct 2018 11:27 am: David Bliss
[Workflow note] After much discussion with Willie, we have kept the same book.  He uses it for its sweeping historical perspective. He has explained his teaching approach in other preparation.14 Oct 2018 1:40 pm: Mickey Zemon
Much improved CD.
There are still two sentences that refer to war in general in the CD.  As Penny mentions above: why people fight wars is a whole other topic and would deserve a course of its own . . .
Third sentence from the beginning:  delete  ""Europe"" from The royal houses of Europe since it is mentioned at the end of the previous sentence.
Third sentence from the end: delete it -- demons or hero is already mentioned in the first sentence and we do not need the rest of the sentence about the necessity of war.
There are too many sentences starting with or mentioning this course or we will.  The fifth sentence could be changed from The purpose of this course to Our objective 
Next to last sentence: missing ""of"" after cons in pros and cons these moral 
Last sentence: There will be a mixture of visual presentations and class discussion.14 Oct 2018 3:26 pm: Addison Stone
I agree that the CD is improved, but, like others, I am worried about the ""war in human history"" theme. Two possible solutions. (1) SGL could insert a statement that the study of NB will serve as a case study of the role/necessity of war. OR (2) delete all references to the broader theme. So, delete ""even today."" Delete sentence beginning ""This course will look at...."". Change ""are willing"" to ""were willing."" With either of those changes, the war focus would be on the particular case of NB. Still a fascinating topic, but without the sense of stretching things too much.
Minor edits: In first sentence, delete space in ""self- centered."" In sentence 2, insert comma after ""glory.""14 Oct 2018 4:39 pm: David Bliss
[Workflow note] CD is altered as per Mickey's and Addison's suggestions.14 Oct 2018 5:38 pm: Addison Stone
Looks good to me. Extraneous comma in third line from bottom.14 Oct 2018 6:36 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree much improved.  I think the CD is fine, but there may be some push back on phrase:  ""...why war seems to be a necessity of civilization. ""  Might it be slightly more circumspect?  ( Don't want to put words in mouth of SGL, if he doesn't feel he can).  ACCEPT14 Oct 2018 7:38 pm: Mickey Zemon
Accept14 Oct 2018 7:41 pm: Penny Revelle
Better, but still seems to focus on war in general rather than Napoleon ( ""- and why war seems to be a necessity of civilization. ""). Is Willy irrevocably attached to this phrase or could it be dropped?.14 Oct 2018 7:51 pm: Ron Ebert
I too see the extraneous comma, but much better and more focused. Let him have his war. Accept14 Oct 2018 7:52 pm: David Bliss
[Workflow note] Some changes  made as suggested.  The course really is about Napoleon as a case study in war.17 Oct 2018 6:01 pm: Fred Chanania
[Workflow note] Committee vote was strongly against, based on two factors:  concern about the ability of SGL to have a successful discussion-based course (based on prior evaluations) and concern about the way the CD was written, which in turn might reflect a course that was not organized well.  Director talk with proposer about the problems identified by the CC, and will also suggest that he work with the TLC before he submits another proposal.  More than usual attention was given to this proposal and to working with SGL to develop an approvable course, and the sponsor did all things possible to represent the course well when presented to the CC for vote. No further action is needed on this proposal as the vote was to reject it.","true","","95","2018-09-28 18:01:12","https://ccsubmit.com/","","","","","","Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/69.0.3497.100 Safari/537.36","24.218.130.38","","complete","complete","complete","complete","approved","complete","","rejected","","","","rejected","","1539813713"

As usual, a well thought out course proposal from John Morrel.  The only change I would like to see is a more stirring opening sentence.  Toni Morrison's quote is apropos but dry.  Maybe something about the headlines and pictures of migrants in small boats, that wring our hearts, or about the pictures of refugees backed up at our own southern borders.  I realize John is intending to look at the broader topic and include stories of people who choose to migrate rather than just those who are forced to move, but as the man who first slugs his donkey with a 2 by 4 and then trains him with kindness explains, ""First you gotta get their attention.""27 Sep 2018 1:58 pm: Mickey Zemon
Sounds like an excellent proposal to me.  In the third sentence, I would suggest separating the clauses with commas rather than semi-colons since they all relate back to the subject and verb ""we will watch.""  Also, maybe at the end of  that sentence ""and others"" could be dropped since the sentence is just giving a taste of of what will be done.  Accept.27 Sep 2018 4:12 pm: Barbara Burr
Agree the first sentence could use reworking.  Much as I love Toni Morrison's writing, ""the spectacle of mass movement"" feels kind of vague and overly general, especially as the SG will focus on very particular stories.  Maybe a quote from one of the books?  ""And others"" not needed or needs explaining.  Good course!27 Sep 2018 4:36 pm: Helen Bakeman
Excellent proposal for a fascinating study group. Agree with Mickey’s comments and also with Penny re: first sentence.  John has indicated number of pages of reading per week as well as hours...I thought that we were not going to do that...need to clarify.27 Sep 2018 5:48 pm: Katherine O'Connor
I agree with the comments related to the opening of the description, and I was, in fact, misled by Morrison's reference to ""the spectacle of mass movement"" since what follows in the CD makes it clear that John is talking about the difficulties and challenges of leaving home in a broader context. It also occurred to me that leaving home must be much easier for some than for others; so is the act of leaving home necessarily always a fiction?  I think, however, that the topic of leaving home and what that means for different people in different circumstances is a wonderful topic in itself with a lot of appeal.  27 Sep 2018 7:22 pm: Frank Speizer
Excellent topic and well thought out..  in second sentence the phrase  “who choose to leave home behind, and those who have no choice” seems awkward  in that no choice to stay.? Or to leave?    The “1974” seems misplaced. ACCEPT 28 Sep 2018 8:08 am: Addison Stone
Agree that this sounds like a compelling SG topic. Nice range of readings. I'm actually okay with the opening sentence. Though the readings seem to zero in on the stories of particular individuals, at least two of the stories take place within the context of mass movements of people. Agree that the semi-colons might be changed to commas, and that ""and others"" is unnecessary. Is the workload really 3 hours? Shouldn't take that long to read 55-65 pages and ponder a few questions. Is there more work involved, or should this be 2 hours?28 Sep 2018 12:56 pm: David Bliss
What the CD describes is mass migration on an individual scale.  ""Mass movements"" to me describes a social phenomenon.  Except for the first sentence, the CD is clear, however the long series of examples would be better if they were all in the same tense.  Make them present indicative: ""returning"" ""leaving"" ""trying"".29 Sep 2018 8:57 am: Susan Harris
I agree with: 
- this is a good topic and proposal
-improving first sentence (will work with John on that)
-replacing semi-colons with commas (as suggested by Mickey)
-""those who had no choice"" is awkward - suggest changing to ""those who were forced to.""
-making tenses consistent (as suggested by David)
-deleting reading pages
I think the following are OK as written:
-1974, used as an adjective to describe San Francisco
-""and others"".  I'm in the minority here, but if you take that phrase out the list can be read as complete when it isn't.
-""fiction"" -- it refers to the genre of reading, not to the experience of leaving29 Sep 2018 4:10 pm: Sara Freedman
Kudos for John for submitting another timely, thought provoking course with a strong and diverse group of authors. Agree with first sentence could be more compelling as well as more reflective of the course itself. The books seem to focus on individual life stories, albeit ones that have been greatly affected by larger geopolitical tensions throughout the world. Would like an explicit mention of how the course will deal with the interplay of the personal with the larger political context. Sounds like a wonderful course, and knowing John as a teacher, should be well subscribed and well taught.30 Sep 2018 12:14 pm: Jim Whitters
Concur with Susan's summary and with those changes----accept.30 Sep 2018 9:36 pm: Ron Ebert
Yes a stronger first sentence is a good idea and current thoughts of immigration come to mind. Very good course topic by very experienced sgl. Accept30 Sep 2018 9:58 pm: Linda Neumann
I actually like the first sentence.  It conveys the enormity of the phenomenon and the attending idea of uprooting.  Then John converges on the individuals and their stories.  Undoubtedly will be a will attended and thoughtful course.  Accept with minor edits.04 Oct 2018 9:15 am: Susan Harris
[Workflow note] No changes made yet.  Working with SGL.04 Oct 2018 2:12 pm: Susan Harris
[Workflow note] I have edited the CD to address the grammar and punctuation comments raised by CC members.  I discussed the opening sentence with John and he feels strongly that he wants to keep it as is for a number of reasons including its familiarity to the 20 people who took a recent course of his and are likely to be among those interested in this one.  I think we should respect his wishes in this  regard, especially as the course is likely to be popular anyway.  He also feels that 3 hours is the correct amount of time needed for the thorough reading of assigned materials that he will expect from SGMs.04 Oct 2018 2:15 pm: Susan Harris

Below is the Extended Description that I will post on the course website:

The novels for this Study Group were not selected at random. When the United States entered the <u>Vietnam</u> conflict, our government was intervening in a foreign country, at first secretly, then openly, attempting to force an outcome viewed as favorable to US strategic interests, namely, restricting the expansion of Russian and/or Chinese communism. When Timothy McVeigh detonated a huge bomb in Oklahoma City, destroying a courthouse and killing hundreds of its occupants, it was the terrorist act of an isolated home-grown <u>anarchist </u>– a direct attack against the government, its properties, its employees and, incidentally, ordinary citizens going about their normal business. When the Taliban orchestrated and executed the intricate attacks of 9/11, a complex act of terrorism against some of the most prominent symbols of the United States, with utter disregard for, indeed, with scorn for the lives of the many people killed, the United States shifted its attention to the <u>Middle East</u> and not only attacked the Taliban in Afghanistan but also carried out an unprovoked invasion of Iraq.  What has followed has been a continuing conflict against one type of insurgency or another, involving both overt and covert warfare, with a mixed degree of disregard for national boundaries and the sovereignty of foreign governments. The threat of terrorism, by individual lone wolves, by insurgent groups, and even by national governments, has become a large component of our daily awareness. It is an important part of current political discourse and colors the debate over the meaning of the welcoming message that is boldly displayed on the Statue of Liberty.

With so many real terrorists around, why study “fictional terrorists”? Actually, novelists have long been intrigued by the emotional and psychological stress that terror invokes. By focusing on individual characters and their stories as created by gifted authors, we can gain insights into the terrorist milieu that complement what we can learn from the grisly stories in daily newspapers and on television. Taken together, the three novels we will study provide a kaleidoscopic view of terrorists and terrorism and the impact they can have on individual lives and society as a whole. We also get the benefit of reading some pretty amazing writers.

The three novels span a full century: <em>The Secret Agent</em> by Joseph Conrad (1907), about <u>anarchists</u> in London and their manipulation by an interfering foreign government; <em>The Quiet American</em> by Graham Greene (1955), about the American intervention in <u>Vietnam</u> prior to the French defeat; <em>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</em> (2007) by Mohsin Hamid, addressing the modern <u>Middle East</u>, albeit in the microcosm of two specific characters in a situation that is presented obliquely. Along the way, we will also view the excellent film adaptation of <em>The Quiet American</em> starring Michael Caine.

This Study Group will be discussion-centric. We will take a multi-faceted look at the three works, spending part of the discussion on the writing, the story structure, the character development, and the degree of reader engagement the author is able to create. We will also address the characteristics of terrorists as represented in these novels, seeking whatever commonality we can find among the three works.  Expect 2-3 hours/week of engaging reading.

I would prefer to take up the three works chronologically, but because <em>The Secret Agent </em>is too long to be read in two weeks, we will start with <em>The Quiet American. </em>An outline of our syllabus is given below:

1: First half of <em>The Quiet American</em>

2: Completion of <em>The Quiet American</em>

3: View and discuss film of <em>The Quiet American</em>; read first third of <em>The Secret Agent</em>

4: Second third of <em>The Secret Agent</em>

5: Completion of <em>The Secret Agent</em>

6: <em>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</em>","25 Sep 2018 4:32 pm: Mickey Zemon
I think he could improve on the first sentence; under Further Information he says --With so many real terrorists around, why study “fictional terrorists”? That seems more like a grabber first sentence to me.  He could then start the second sentence, To answer this question, we shall read . . .
He needs to separate the descriptions of the three books with commas not periods since they follow a colon.
Hamid’s The Reluctant Fundamentalist moves us -- suggest changing moves to transports 
Move the sentence about writing style to before the sentence on viewing the film since it directly relates to  the previous sentence about the three books.
Last sentence: change terror to terrorism -- not all terror is from terrorism.
Reading these three novels in 6 weeks is lots of reading.  It is too bad that there will be only one class session to discuss The Reluctant Fundamentalist.  Maybe the students could watch the film on their own outside class and he could use the session this frees up for a second class discussion of that novel.
25 Sep 2018 7:15 pm: Frank Speizer
There is not much to fault for this experienced SGL who has done this before, albeit, in a different genre. I think Mickey's suggestion  to move the indication of the film closer to the description is right.  The Reluctant Fundamentalist is a short fast read and I think will work with one session.  ACCEPT25 Sep 2018 8:17 pm: Ron Ebert
The cd is short and would be enhanced by some of his “extended description”. For example the second paragraph in that extended material provides a much more clear explanation of the course goals that is lacking in the cd. I do wonder about fitting all of this into six weeks. Could he drop the film or one of the books?25 Sep 2018 8:29 pm: Katherine O'Connor
My comments relate to how the CD packages the course topic and not to the topic itself. I thought that the first three sentences of the second paragraph of his Extended Description would serve as an excellent introduction to his CD for the course catalogue. This echoes Mickey's concerns as well. His penultimate sentence on the ""three writing styles"" is vague and unclear. There are punctuation issues as well. 25 Sep 2018 11:30 pm: Penny Revelle
Except for the suggestion about moving the sentence about the film to after the sentence about writing style, I like the CD exactly as it is - clear, concise and interesting.  I think it has the flavor of Mike's personality and when a   CD achieves that I believe we shouldn't mess with it too much.26 Sep 2018 4:37 am: Susan Harris
I agree that the punctuation following the colon needs to be fixed and that the sentence about writing style should be moved.  I do like “With so many real terrorists around...” as an opening sentence but think it should be offered as a suggestion rather than a requirement.26 Sep 2018 9:11 am: Addison Stone
I like the basic idea for this SG, but I agree with comments suggesting that a lot is packed into too short a schedule. It might work, but Steve will have to be diligent in steering discussion efficiently if he is to accomplish his multi-faceted goals for analyzing these books and related issues. I wonder if he's be open to expanding the course into 8 or 10 weeks? One solution for the sentence beginning with ""We shall read..."" is to add some content to that short sentence, along the lines of ""We shall read three terrorist-oriented novels that deal vividly with the personalities and cultural settings in which terrorism takes root."" Then, the next three sentences would follow as written. Note the typo in the publisher of the third book.26 Sep 2018 11:04 am: Jim Whitters
I concur with Addison that this course, as set forth, should consider 10 class sessions. It certainly is an attractive course as described but is the reading simply too much to read and discuss in 6 weeks?26 Sep 2018 11:38 pm: Barbara Burr
I agree that the second paragraph of the extended information is better written than the CD.  Also wonder if 3 books and a film are too much for 6wks.  Overall a fine topic.27 Sep 2018 8:26 am: Fred Chanania
Sara:  I think it's a bit unclear if the film The Quiet American will be viewed in class or whether the SGMs are supposed to view it at home as homework.  This probably should be clarified in the CD.  If it is NOT going to be homework, then remove reference in the ""other required materials"" section.

Sounds like a very thought-provoking course by a new member who is well qualified to be an excellent SGL. 
The fourth sentence, starting with We will immerse ourselves: an ""of"" was left out  between origins and Huck's.  I also recommend deleting (was Huck black?) in this sentence which is already very long.  
Also in this sentence: unrelenting use of the N-word and the limits of satire -- these seem like two unrelated observations that should be separated from each other by a comma.25 Sep 2018 11:54 am: Barbara Burr
Fine idea for a SG.  I completely agree with Mickey's edit suggestions.  It should be fascinating to read a variety of criticisms and analyses.25 Sep 2018 12:52 pm: Sara Freedman
Agree with both comments above. ""Unrelenting use (of is missing). Would like additional critiques representing the African American community. Right now I believe there is only one, Toni Morrison's. Might be some interesting articles about the issues that arise when the book has been taught in a variety of classrooms.25 Sep 2018 12:52 pm: Susan Harris
Great idea presented in an exciting way.  I agree with Mickey’s  adding of “of” and a comma.  I could go either way on “Was Huck black?”  The sentence is long but the question is intriguing.  Should the CD mention that the course is primarily discussion?25 Sep 2018 7:26 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with slight edits as suggested above.  I think leaving in  ""Was Huck black"" is interesting and add a twist.  Query are there other data, but maybe Toni Morrison has raised the issue sufficiently that others are not necessary.  I assume that Sara is suggesting that the issues raised by variety of classrooms might relate to gender, age, race of the classroom setting.  There may be scholarly work on these issues, but if not it might get difficult  to get meaningful discussion, rather than just speculation.  Agree this works as a course, and with edit ACCEPT 25 Sep 2018 8:42 pm: Katherine O'Connor
I applaud the topic and the focus of this course. The too long sentence that begins with ""We will immerse ourselves"" is syntactically very messy (faulty parallelism) and should be rewritten. The additional required and optional readings are varied and provocative. Sounds like a stimulating course.25 Sep 2018 11:18 pm: Penny Revelle
This looks like an interesting and timely course.
I would leave out ""(was Huck black)"", not that it's not an intriguing comment but because the sentence is already long and complicated.  It will still be an interesting discussion topic for one of the class sessions.  I'm OK with the rest of the sentence.  I don't think the parallelism is faulty but thank you Katherine for the term - I knew there must be a term for that grammatical error, but didn't know what it was.26 Sep 2018 8:54 am: Addison Stone
Sounds like an intriguing and thoughtful SG focus. I like the varied 'side' readings. Should make for lively, provocative discussions. I agree with the edits suggested above. Otherwise, I say Accept. One possible addition, probably to the optional readings, would be something representing the thinking of local schools/libraries that have taken the book off the curriculum and/or the shelves.26 Sep 2018 1:10 pm: Ron Ebert
Reviewing members comments demonstrates just how interesting this course will be. I would keed is huck black, but agree that the sentence should be shortened and rewritten. With above edits, accept26 Sep 2018 2:09 pm: David Bliss
For a 6-week course, there are many possible readings listed in ""other preparation"" .  Are these excerpts all to be posted on the class website? If they are required, it should be understood how they will be disseminated. It would be good to check with this new SGL to see if he is comfortable with using Canvas.27 Sep 2018 8:37 am: Fred Chanania

I think that this needs to be rewritten.  The topic may be interesting and timely, but presentation is a little confusing.  The third sentence (with five uses of democracy, democratic, etc) is unclear to me.  The Bill of Rights is anti-democratic? Or is it a guardrail?  Can he introduce the concept of guardrails before that?  
""The SG's goal is to understand what kinds of changes can be made to strengthen democracy.""  Perhaps change to ""should be made"" or ""need to be made"" or ""could be made"".  Perhaps move the goal of the course more to the beginning.
He should say something about the books.
Instead of ""topics include"" , ""we shall discuss...""  Do the texts cover those topics?

 24 Sep 2018 2:12 pm: Addison Stone
I agree with Linda that  this CD is confusing.  Needs a major rewrite. SGL needs to explain what is undemocratic about the Bill of Rights. I assume it has to do with constraining others? This tension between total freedom and reasoned constraints on behavior may be a key issue here, but it is not explicit. The sudden shift to ""topics"" in paragraph two is jarring. Does he mean ""instances"" within which the tensions alluded to in paragraph one will be explored? The last sentence should come earlier. Say something about how the two texts fit in. Also, is this discussion-based? On a minor note, I would hyphenate both ""mob dominated"" and ""upper class"" in sentence two. I assume that the opinion pieces mentioned under Other Prep are actually Other Required Materials?24 Sep 2018 4:36 pm: Ron Ebert
Yes, a rewrite is necessary- and remove many of those commas. Perhaps start with last sentence: ""The goal of this course is to understand what changes can be made to strengthen democracy, given that such forms of government are rare and often short lived.""24 Sep 2018 5:45 pm: Barbara Burr
I too was confused.  Perhaps some mention of the point of view and purpose of the the two chosen books in terms of the content of the SG...24 Sep 2018 6:05 pm: David Bliss
At 128 words, this CD has a lot of room for elaboration.  He could continue the metaphor of cliffs and guardrails by defining what those might be.  Some information about how the class will be run would also be useful.  The readings are very ambitious; the Klarman book is 840 pages, and the other required are also quite lengthy.  How much of the course will be about how the constitution was written versus discussion of how it is coming apart? Sounds like he should think about a syllabus to narrow it down a bit.24 Sep 2018 8:09 pm: Mickey Zemon
Cliffs and Guardrails -- this description must be in one of the books  or other materials he is using.  However, to introduce these words in the title and not elaborate on them in the CD is confusing.  Perhaps it would be better to just eliminate them from the title altogether.
I like the first two sentences but not the third one.  It sounds like he is saying that the Bill of Rights is both undemocratic and an undemocratic constitutional restraint.  This sentence needs a rewrite so it is clear what he is talking about.
Those topics could be rephrased as questions, for example: How does the internet impact our changing conceptions of free speech?  What are the implications of the marketplace's attitude toward regulation on democracy?  In what ways does the impact of the breakdown of trust on rule of law ...?
The two sentences starting with the SGL could be combined into one and moved to the end: The SG's goal is to discuss if some of the safeguards of democracy have become counterproductive and to understand what kinds of changes can be made to strengthen this form of government.  I think he should tighten this wording so that it expresses just what he intends to accomplish in this course.
In his bio, he needs to spell out Mass.
I think a very interesting course could  emerge from the second draft of this CD.

I know Joe as an excellent trial attorney and wordsmith. I concur with much of the commentary and recommend that this CD be rewritten. The course appears to have great potential but the amount of reading seems to be far too much. Klarman's superb book was the subject, by itself, of Sarah's course last Spring on the writing of the Constitution.25 Sep 2018 9:43 am: Helen Bakeman
I agree that he should drip Cliffs and Guardrails from the title....it would take a bunch of words in the CD to make clear what those words really mean within the context of this SG.  Move the last sentence to the beginning and broaden it—goal also seems to be to understand the weaknesses and contradictions built into our constitutional framework. Agree seems to be too much reading.  Third sentence is a jumble of too many “democratic” words...this is the sentence where he needs to clearly turn to the US and its constitution and sound less general (in the US, the Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution because.......; however, ......... and elebaorate from there.25 Sep 2018 9:56 am: Katherine O'Connor
I absolutely agree that the CD needs to be rewritten. The third sentence is the beginning of the problem. Is he saying that there is no such thing as a restraint that is not un- or anti- democratic? The reading seems overwhelmingly demanding.25 Sep 2018 1:07 pm: Sara Freedman
I agree that the CD is confusing and seems to be a fishing expedition about the inherent and lived problems with democracy, in the United States and the rest of the world. Doesn't seem to have a clear focus or thesis to focus the course. It is also not clear how the books will be used. The Klarman book is very long and dense, and it does not deal with the history of the Constitution after the inclusion of the Bill of Rights, yet the questions all deal with the history of democracy in the U.S. after its ratification. The second book seems to be a thoughtful discussion of the recent crises experienced by mostly Western democracies. I'm wondering if he wants to substitute the Klarman book with another book that focuses on problems of modern democracies but with perhaps a different slant than the one he has chosen. That would strengthen the focus and provide some good debate among current ways of thinking about democracy's strengths and weaknesses, and whether this form of government actually has a future in the coming generations.26 Sep 2018 5:04 am: Susan Harris
I agree that this needs to be rewritten for the reasons given above.  I think it would be possible to present the “ cliffs and guardrails” metaphor intelligibly if the SGL is wedded to it, but I agree it is not working as is.   From others’ comments the Klarman book seems like a poor choice: it’s too long given the other readings, its focus is on an earlier time period than the course’s focus, and it was recently covered in depth by another course.27 Sep 2018 8:20 am: Fred Chanania
Penny:  The other required materials section should be changed to match our usual practice.  Something like:  The SGL will post other required readings (book excerpts) on the course website.27 Sep 2018 12:06 pm: Penny Revelle
[Workflow note] I have posted the tentative syllabus which Re: Cliffs and Guardrails:  I have posted the tentative syllabus Joe sent me under ""additional information for the CC"".  I think this answers some of the criticisms about not knowing what he intends to present/discuss and would like CC members to read it.28 Sep 2018 7:57 am: Addison Stone
Penny, am I right that the CD remains unchanged? (Here's where access to the original CD would be helpful!) If so, does that mean that you and/or the Joe feel that it does not need any changes? Or is the inclusion of the syllabus info merely an intermediate step in the revision process?29 Sep 2018 4:26 pm: Sara Freedman
I am glad to see that the course has been extended to full term, but other than that I don't detect any real changes. It would be very helpful to see each week's readings as I am concerned that the readings as a whole are far too much for anyone to read and comment on thoughtfully. I'm also not clear how each reading responds to each question.  03 Oct 2018 2:06 pm: Mickey Zemon
I do not see any changes to the CD.  It is still two paragraphs and 134 words.  Not having the original to compare it to is a disadvantage. 03 Oct 2018 8:54 pm: David Bliss
Changes are not visible.07 Oct 2018 12:51 pm: Penny Revelle
[Workflow note] The CD and title have been rewritten to address committee comments.  In addition, I have tried to indicate that the whole of the Klaman book will not be required.  I added this under other required materials because I didn't know how else to show it.
Quest: do commas go inside parentheses?07 Oct 2018 1:04 pm: Sara Freedman
Thanks for the clarification about the changes made. Still concerned about the focus. The topic suggests it will discuss democracy as an institution in many different situations, but most of each week seems to be focused on the example of the U.S. Will the focus be on democracy writ large or specifically on the U.S.? 
Also, first week is exhaustive, could easily be divided into at least two weeks or more. Big leap from Week 2 to Week 3. Week 3 is also packed with major themes. Seems some support in figuring out the focus of each week would be helpful.07 Oct 2018 1:43 pm: Mickey Zemon
This revised CD is so much better. 
I  agree with the comments Sara makes above.
I do not think there should be a colon in the 4th sentence -- We will discuss: the changing conceptions of free speech
The SGs goal in the last sentence should be The SG's goal.
07 Oct 2018 4:15 pm: Addison Stone
The title and the CD work well together now. Indeed, my main concern relates to the syllabus and its relation to the CD. Seems like the SGL is trying to do way too much, ranging beyond what the CD seems to promise. The list of subtopics in week 1 is daunting; could be an entire SG of its own. I’m assuming that the SGL is planning to present some of this in the form of a lecture, rather than raising each question in succession for group discussion? In general, the mix of structured presentation versus discussion could be mentioned. Also, there seems to be another tension. The issues listed in the CD after “We will discuss” all seem to reflect quite current quandaries, but the syllabus reads more like a history of our democracy and its tensions. Which should be foregrounded—the history or the current issues?
I agree about dropping the colon in sentence 4. Also, in sentence 1 “short lived” should probably be hyphenated.
07 Oct 2018 4:26 pm: Ron Ebert
Much better now that it clarifies both cliffs and guardrails. I think the” we shall discuss: “ needs a bit of a rewrite. Perhaps break into two sentences and get rid of the  : . 08 Oct 2018 2:40 pm: Jim Whitters
I agree with Sara that the readings as a whole appear to be overwhelming for the class members to comment on thoughtfully. This is certainly a 12 week course but it still needs a more disciplined focus. 09 Oct 2018 10:18 am: David Bliss
Much better course description, but what part will be lecture and what part will be discussion?  The syllabus indicates the SGL will give presentations on a variety of historical subjects, and the CD talks about discussion of contemporary issues. Has he planned the ratio of lecture/discussion?10 Oct 2018 4:21 pm: Fred Chanania
[Workflow note] remove language in third sentence

[Workflow note] I have tried to address all the concerns brought up in Wednesday's meeting: "" focus is really on US,"" ""still not entirely clear why words cliffs and guardrails are used,' ""confusing use of the word undemocratic for the Bill of Rights"" and slightly too long a CD.  It's now 149 words and,  I hope, reads better.12 Oct 2018 2:58 pm: Linda Neumann
Nice work, Penny.  I think this clarifies the issues.  12 Oct 2018 3:45 pm: Helen Bakeman
I am not sure if we use the abbreviation SG but rather spell it out with new initial caps (in last sentence of course description). If I ignore the syllabus, which I believe we were instructed to do yesterday, this is fine.  (Otherwise, we have a syllabus that has 1/2 of the sessions focused on democratic and US constitutional history but a CD that focuses almost entirely on current issues (eg, effect of internet, breakdown of trust) andlooking forward).12 Oct 2018 5:11 pm: Sara Freedman
Much clearer, more delineated. Good work.12 Oct 2018 6:14 pm: Jim Whitters
much more clarity and discipline now---still seems to be a very ambitious undertaking. The SGL should comment on the books and how he intends to use them in the course.12 Oct 2018 8:48 pm: Barbara Burr
Does read better.  Doesn't capture the daunting scope of the syllabus, (but then we don't commonly see the syllabi of the courses...) Accept13 Oct 2018 8:30 am: Susan Harris
I would get rid of the colon but, otherwise, I think this CD is fine now.  Even the cliffs and guardrails are now comprehensible.  The syllabus does need work but I like Fred's suggestion to have TLC help with that.  13 Oct 2018 11:00 am: David Bliss
Very good revision.  I want to take this course!13 Oct 2018 11:51 am: Fred Chanania
Penny, looks good to me.  Two re-writes if you can:
Third sentence has a number of misplaced modifiers and awkward syntax.  Would you be willing to just massage it a bit to read:  With a primary focus on the US, we will discuss the changing conceptions of free speech (especially the internet’s impact), the implications in democracy from the marketplace's attitude toward regulation, the result of the breakdown of trust on the rule of law, and whether some of the safeguards originally included in our Constitution have become counterproductive. 
Last sentence: ""such forms"" should be changed to ""this form"" since we are only talking about the one form - democracy.13 Oct 2018 3:50 pm: Sara Freedman
Good work in helping with the rewrite. Thanks.13 Oct 2018 3:55 pm: Addison Stone
Nice changes. Agree with Fred re need to tinker with third sentence. Also, agree that someone in TLC should talk with SGL about seeming mismatch between CD and syllabus. I suspect that it's a matter of adjusting superordinates and subordinate topic in the outline, but who knows. At an editorial level, I still think that ""short lived"" (sentence 1), ""mob dominated"" (sentence 2), and ""upper class"" (sentence 2) should be hyphenated. Also, consider adding a comma after ""democracies"" in sentence 2.13 Oct 2018 4:08 pm: Penny Revelle
[Workflow note] I have deleted a comma in sentence 2, adde a hyphen to mob-dominated, written out Study Group instead of SG and accepted most of Fred's rewrite of sentence 3.

Interesting topic, perhaps complements the other SG proposal on the Enlightenment... Regarding the first sentence: I think not everyone might know that it is actually a book she is using.  Also, the structure and punctuation are odd.  The SGL presumes to know “many of us” have little reason for optimism.  This is certainly an unnuanced and sweeping assumption....depends what you are talking about etc. But I think this is basically a provacative and interesting topic for a SG.21 Sep 2018 2:12 pm: David Bliss
A good topic with a strong study group leader. I get it that she is not just just a cheerleader for the neo-liberal view.  But rather than saying ""many of us are not optimistic"" perhaps better to say ""a world that for many, has failed to fulfill the promise of those values.""22 Sep 2018 7:49 am: Susan Harris
Replace the second colon of the first sentence with ""including"" or get rid of it some other way.  Otherwise I'm fine with the writing and would accept as is.22 Sep 2018 8:38 am: Ron Ebert
First sentence structure is awkward ( length of life, health, wealth...). Perhaps put length of life at end of list, or use modifiers for each of the items. Otherwise well written and very interesting. Accept.22 Sep 2018 9:45 am: Linda Neumann
Interesting topic with a book that has engendered a lot of discussion and controversy.  The bio is very short - perhaps she should include the remark in her comment that this course overlaps or repeats some of the material in her previous course.  As everyone noted, need to clean up the first sentence with the double colons.  Accept22 Sep 2018 1:19 pm: Jim Whitters
very attractive course with much substance to encourage robust debate led by a SGL who possesses considerable experience in dealing with real world issues-----agreeing with above recommendations-----Accept.23 Sep 2018 8:53 am: Sara Freedman
This should be a provocative study group, appealing to a wide swath of members. I have no objection to the ""many of us are not optimistic"" since that rings true to me, at the very least, and is the basis of the study group itself. That is, that many look to the future with trepidation. Pinker posits a quite different view, so it is good to explore his ideas systematically and thoroughly. I am confident Mary Jo will do just that.23 Sep 2018 9:28 am: Helen Bakeman
Excellent SGL with an important topic and book.  Agree with Sara that there  really is no problem with “many of us are not optimistic”....it is true (she is not saying MOST of us). Colons in first sentence—agree with Linda’s comment and wonder if there should be a capital “Since’ after the first colon. Otherwise, leave it as it is...it is her voice23 Sep 2018 9:22 pm: Penny Revelle
Well, I would go with ""some of us,""  just to show that she is willing to accept other people's point of view and also so readers don't get the feeling that she is going to disagree strongly with the author of the book she has chosen.
I agree that the sentence about her previous course would be useful in the biography.
I've read several of Pinker's books and wonder if 2 hours will be enough prep time for everybody.
Sounds like an interesting course, though - lots to discuss.23 Sep 2018 9:25 pm: Penny Revelle
addendum:  that would be about 60 pages/week24 Sep 2018 9:12 am: Addison Stone
I agree that this will be an excellent SG. A definite Accept. I was a participant in last year's version, and I thought Mary Jo did an excellent job. She does presume some facility with data/graph interpretation, which proved a challenge for a small number of folks last year, but she flags that issue here. Also, doubt that Pinker's book has anywhere near as many detailed graphs as Angus Deaton's book had. I like David's suggested rewrite of the ""optimism"" sentence. Also, I found the sentence beginning with ""Study group meetings will consist..."" to be a bit awkward. How about, ""Study group meetings will consist largely of structured discussions of the Pinker book as some supplementary readings provided by the SGL."" Also, note that this sentence seems to suggest that the supplementary readings are an integral part of the SG, but her statement under Other Prep says that only the book is required. Inconsistent. Finally, like Penny, I wonder if 2 hours is the right estimate for workload, especially if the supplemental readings really are required. Yes, she should mention the connection to last year's SG in her bio (if that's the right place).25 Sep 2018 9:49 am: Katherine O'Connor
Sorry I'm coming to this so late. The SGL already has experience with this topic in a previous course - which is a good thing --but I wondered about the repetition issue if she hopes to appeal to some of those who were in her other course. I applaud a critical discussion of the Pinker book!27 Sep 2018 8:17 am: Fred Chanania
Mickey:  In the ""other preparation"" section, there is this sentence:  I will provide some supplementary materials to challenge and/or complement Pinker's arguments.  Required reading will be only the book.
We have a general type of boilerplate for this to avoid repetition and inconsistency.  Something like:  The SGL will post other required materials on the course website.  
The boilerplate (sort of) could also read:  The SGL will post other required materials analyzing Pinker's arguments on the course website.
We would probably ask for this change at the vote or the co-chairs would do it during their final review.  Let's do it now if possible.  Thanks03 Oct 2018 7:26 pm: Mickey Zemon
Has the World Really Been Making Progress?

In <em>Enlightenment Now</em>, Steve Pinker makes a deeply optimistic argument: Since the time of the 18<sup>th</sup> century Enlightenment, humanity has made great progress in myriad domains, including longevity, health, wealth, peace, safety, human rights, happiness and more.  Progress, he argues, can continue into the future if we learn and apply the Enlightenment lessons of reason, science and humanism.  This study group will critically examine Pinker’s assumptions, methodology, data and arguments.  As we look carefully at the material he presents, we will collectively test our own ideas about a world that for some of us presents little reason for optimism.  Study group meetings will consist largely of structured discussions of the Pinker book.  Some supplementary readings will be provided on the website by the SGL. SGMs should be willing to engage with data and simple graphs and to participate in sometimes controversial discussions.

&nbsp;

Mary Jo Bane taught public policy analysis for many years at the Harvard Kennedy School.  Last year she led a study group that focused on a few of the issues that Pinker deals with.  She looks forward to continuing the conversations.

Memoir writing seems popular!  6-8 pages a week is quite a bit if all 4 books are also to be read.  Will submissions need to be made ahead so everyone can read all of them?  Who does the ""delicate"" editing?  How will that be received? Why is the CD in italics?19 Sep 2018 5:22 pm: Mickey Zemon
I love the title and the tone of the CD -- but the italics have got to go.  It seems like a heavy load of reading but she does say excerpts from these novels.  She will have to copy those excerpts and distribute copies to the class. These excerpts should not be too long because these novels are under copyright.
Judy is very well qualified and will make an excellent SGL.  
19 Sep 2018 6:02 pm: Mickey Zemon
Ugh, forgot to mention two typos in first sentence:  a a memoir and words(less).19 Sep 2018 6:06 pm: David Bliss
To write a memoir each week for twelve weeks seems a bit challenging.  Is that how Suzanne Pemsler ran the course? I think she should think about the format of the class, and maybe tighten up the part about the book selections. 19 Sep 2018 8:23 pm: Ron Ebert
Suzanne didn't require a memoir every week- i think judy should ease that requirement too. Perhaps ask members to select one excerpt at a time from one of the books.  Not enough time to cover that material as well as the memoirs. Judy is just the right person to lead this class. Accept. 19 Sep 2018 9:40 pm: Jim Whitters
Appears to be an excellent course but I am wondering whether there is too much writing over a 12 week period. Otherwise, accept.19 Sep 2018 10:12 pm: Helen Bakeman
I don’t know what the etiquette is but.,..my understanding was that Jean Speizer was going to pick up the mantle for memoi writing (she is leading the course this term).  Should someone check in with her? We do need clarification about the reading (does everyone have to buy all of the books? Or do you get and read what you would like?) and about whether writing will really be required each week.  20 Sep 2018 9:19 am: Susan Harris
In addition to this being a lot of writing, it doesn't seem realistic to me to discuss 12 memoirs in each class (class size max is 12).  That would give only 10 mins per proposal even if there were no breaks or time spent on housekeeping issues.  I don't see anything inherently wrong with two people doing memoir classes if the demand is there.  Is it?  20 Sep 2018 9:54 am: Dick Rubinstein
I agree that the primary issue here is the structure of the course, in terms of preparation and how much can be done in each class. Yes, and kill the italics. Not ready for a vote.

A more general issue: Books that are not to be purchased (e.g. excerpts to be supplied, or available in the HILR library) should probably not be listed in the catalog at all, lest people think they have to go out and buy them. Reference to specific materials to be handed out are fine in the CD, but don’t need to be exhaustive.20 Sep 2018 11:31 am: Addison Stone
I agree that this proposal needs more thought. I don't see how SGM's could realistically write their own memoir AND read thoughtfully those of 11 other people in the time frame mentioned. Also, the role of the books needs clarification. Certainly, they should not all be required if the writing/critiquing assignment is not altered. I think we should send this one back to the SGL with a list of issues to consider. It is also important to consider how many other memoir-writing SG's may be in the works.20 Sep 2018 1:06 pm: Frank Speizer
I can clarify one issue.  Jeanne Speizer (was actually hoping Judy would step forward) is not back in town early enough to be able to offer this course in the Spring semester.  23 Sep 2018 8:57 am: Sara Freedman
Agree with above comments, in that course needs more thought - too many books, too much writing required, not clear how all of what she outlines can be realistically done in one course period. I like her spirit, which should be retained in the rewrite.23 Sep 2018 9:11 pm: Penny Revelle
So, have we changed the most commonly used prep time required from 3 hours per week to 4?  Is this a recognition of how much time it actually takes to prepare for a course or just random drift?  Maybe  we should discuss this and give proposal submitters guidance?
Also there does seem to be a disconnect between how much the sgl would like people to write and how much time there is to discuss it.  Maybe only part of the class, in rotation, could write and submit a memoir and then there would be time to discuss the submissions.
The four books together come to $36 on Amazon so that's within our guidelines, but the total page count comes to 1248 pages which seems a lot for a writing course.  If she only means the sgls to read parts of the books, that needs to be more clearly explained.  From the way it is stated now I couldn't tell if she meant they would read parts of the books in class or just what parts they wanted to at home.  Also, no need to retell the books in the CD when they are listed in the book section.24 Sep 2018 6:41 pm: Linda Neumann
[Workflow note] Several changes:  
1)  The method of submitting copies of memoirs for discussion in the next session is the format that Suzanne used and it worked well
2)  Judy has removed all the four  books as required reading.  Nothing required, but some optional reading may be posted.
3) The CD is quite short and I suggested adding  some more enticements, but she didn't see the need.

She loved Suzanne's course and uses it as a model.

Suggestions?24 Sep 2018 6:43 pm: Linda Neumann
[Workflow note] When I was in edit mode, I could delete the books from the table, but not the text that appeared below.

There are no books required.25 Sep 2018 9:37 am: Katherine O'Connor
I agree with the concerns abut the workload. The length of the required weekly memoir also sounded extreme. Couldn't there be some guidance about the different kinds of things memoir writing can focus on?  Is the weekly memoir writing assignment always completely open?25 Sep 2018 7:54 pm: Frank Speizer
I think there may be some confusion in the CD that needs clarification.  I don't think a weekly submission is required.  In fact from my knowledge from Jeanne's past experience is that Susan (and Jeanne) never anticipated that all members of the class would submit each week.  In addition by indicating ""up to 2000 word"" which probably sounds like a little for Judy, sounds like a lot to most of us non-regular writers, and simply to indicate something like short vignettes, or memoir pieces, without a word count would probably be more attractive.  The issue of 4 hours is an interesting one, in that the general feedback in the course is that everyone seems to become committed to doing the time/week required to review all of the weeks submissions.  With modest re-write ACCEPT  27 Sep 2018 8:35 am: Fred Chanania
Linda:  Since there are no other required materials, there should be a blank space in the Other Required Materials section.  Please remove the text that is there.  Thanks.03 Oct 2018 8:51 pm: David Bliss
I still have trouble with each member writing each week a 2000 word memoir.  I couldn't do it myself.  Maybe I could write a short vignette, but I don't have enough energy to write a memoir each week.  Just me.  Will there be time enough in class to read them and discuss each one individually?  04 Oct 2018 6:00 pm: Judy Elstein
I’m concerned that there is no book nor a clear indication of what readings might be presented on the website.  In the first draft Mary Karr, Stephen King, and Alexandra Fuller were mentioned as models of memoirist.  All three have written excellent and quite different memoirs.  The SGL can use samples from each or choose one, but those sources should be indicated in the CD. Agree that class participants should not make the choice of reading as was indicated in first draft, but SGL certainly can.    
 
09 Oct 2018 8:32 pm: Frank Speizer
There is such a history for this course, I think that those who sign up know what they are getting into.  Clearly, the members seem to self regulate how often they submit a vignette. I think you just need Judy to modify the 2000 words that seems to be stymieing us all12 Oct 2018 11:51 pm: Linda Neumann
[Workflow note] After I discussed with several members familiar with memoir courses, we have taken out the requirement to submit a memoir of up to 2000 words per week. (Judy is a professional writer and that seemed natural to her.)  Judy will work out the frequency of memoirs with the SGMs in class.  We have added references to additional memoirs for reading.  No books required.

Note:  after I deleted the books from the required list, I was not able to delete the books from the ""Readings Catalog Text"" field.  I changed prep time to 3 hours, but could not change it in the ""Course Info Catalog Text"" field.  Does this matter?13 Oct 2018 6:23 am: Barbara Burr
I think it sounds much better. A flexible approach to the writing assignments in terms os frequency, length etc seems most codusive to participants’ variable needs. Choice of memoir examples is excellent. Gentle editing is a good way of putting it.13 Oct 2018 8:44 am: Addison Stone
Does seem more realistic in terms of reading/writing. However, I'm not clear re the role of the sample memoirs. No books are now required, but will the memoir excerpts be required? If not, why highlight them in the CD? Will SGL 
 provide any upfront orientation re approaches to writing memoirs and/or give suggestions for topic/lifestage/angle to address in choosing what to write about, or will SGMs be left totally on their own to write whatever? The latter seems a be too free-form, at least for me, and to insure a bit of chaos in the group discussions. 13 Oct 2018 9:18 am: Susan Harris
I find the tone of the CD a little light but can live with it.  I would not be in favor of adding a lot of reading or imposing too much structure on the course.   I know, from having lead two prior writing courses here, that the SGL needs flexibility to ensure that everyone has a chance to discuss his/her work in some depth.  The length of written pieces and the frequency of presentation need to be managed by the SGL in real time to make that happen.  I expect that many SGMs will have work in progress that they will continue working on in the SG -- thus specific assignments may be useful for some (memoir newbies) but not helpful for others.  Certain to be popular.13 Oct 2018 9:22 am: Mickey Zemon
Last sentence: Does she mean she will post excerpts from these memoirs or the entire memoir on the course website? Are these memoirs going to be discussed in class?  These memoirs are published works so she is not going to be able to link to them on the internet.  Is she going to scan them?  How much is she going to scan from the original? 
13 Oct 2018 11:31 am: Penny Revelle
It looks to me as if adding the words ""excerpts from""  to the sentence ""The SGL will post selected memoirs by Mary Karr, Stephen King, and Alexandra Fuller on the website for additional reading.""  Would solve lot of the committee's concerns.  
Otherwise I think the fluid nature of the description of how the course is structured is right for this course - it will take its final structure from the SGMs who sign up.13 Oct 2018 12:01 pm: Helen Bakeman
I think that Penny’s suggestion of “exerpts from” takes care of the posted memoir issue.  Accept13 Oct 2018 1:32 pm: Linda Neumann

Throughout this period, fights for press freedoms were front and center. Printers, publishers, writers, and editors faced threats of seditious libel and played a major role in convincing the people to seek independence, ratify the constitution, and establish a culture of acceptance of dissent.

Seems like a relevant and interesting historical topic.  Since the SG is based solely on events of the 18th century, and since the syllabus he suggests does not include any current discussions of the role of the press, I do wonder if the SGL plans to go back to the questions he raises in the first two sentences of the CD?19 Sep 2018 5:06 pm: Mickey Zemon
I agree with Barbara.  He mentions the implications for our country today in the second sentence and third sentence and again in the last sentence -- but he needs to spell out that connection more clearly in the course description.  Maybe he could move sentence two and three to the end of the proposal and clarify the connection there.
The sentence starting with Throughout this period is very long and could easily be divided into two sentences.  In that sentence there should be a comma between writers and editors -- i.e., writers, and editors.
Sounds like a good course.

19 Sep 2018 8:16 pm: Ron Ebert
I like Mickey’s idea of moving the first two sentences to the end and linking to the course. Remove “the” before freedom of the press in first sentence. Good idea for a course.19 Sep 2018 9:35 pm: Jim Whitters
The focus of the course appears to be on the press in the American colonies in the 18th century----I would keep the focus on the 18th century and illustrate the important litigation that occurred then that ultimately had an important impact later on upon American libel law. This should be an interesting course.19 Sep 2018 9:46 pm: Linda Neumann
Agree with Barbara.  The syllabus and most of the CD describe a course in the history of the  press in 18th century.  I admit that I do see what the implications are for our present situation, especially considering the different environment with the technology and tools of modern communication.  Perhaps he could add something specific on lessons learned or not learned.  Or devote part of the syllabus to show similarities to our present situation.20 Sep 2018 9:30 am: Susan Harris
I agree with the above.  The first two sentences make one expect a course about contemporary issues but the description as a whole describes something different.  Either focus on the 18th century as Jim suggests OR better integrate 18th century events with current events as others have suggested.  I think the SGL should have that choice.20 Sep 2018 10:01 am: David Bliss
The first sentence of the CD is a good one to attract interest, but it seems clear that the course is really about the history of press freedom.  Maybe the CD should make it more clear that this is not a current events course.20 Sep 2018 11:24 am: Addison Stone
I agree that there is a seeming tension between the exclusive focus on 18th century issues signaled by the topic list and readings versus the hints regarding implications for today. If the opening is merely an attention-grabber, then that should be signaled somehow. If, however, the SGL is serious about making that connection, he might consider some adjustment to the topic list and/0r readings? Alternatively, he might consider the value of a running study question that focuses SGM's and at least some discussion on implications flowing from each weekly focus for today's issues.20 Sep 2018 1:18 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree this is an interesting topic as a historical look at freedom of the press.  There just may be too much material to really be able to get into contemporary ideas for each session as well.  Agree that moving sentences on the ideas of comparing current time would be better toward the end of the CD.  That is in fact what the Sessions outline says is going to happen.  In sentence 5, I think the ""are"" should be ""were"".  23 Sep 2018 9:07 am: Sara Freedman
I agree that starting with today's issues misleads the reader, as it seems to suggest that considerable time will be spent on a comparison between the issues facing the press during the 18th century and today. Would start with announcing that the course will focus on the 18th century, noting that the issues of publication and suppression laid the groundwork, and/or are similar to, those facing the press throughout the country's history. (Or is he saying that the 18th century was different from subsequent ones?) Could start with sentence with ""In this course..."" while extending the sentence to make clear the course will cover the struggles over publication and suppression. Love the idea of using primary source material, something this SGL has used in his other courses. 23 Sep 2018 8:47 pm: Penny Revelle
I think that the second sentence should be removed because it implies that the course will deal substantially with present day press issues while the further information section makes clear that this is not so.
Also, in the current 5th sentence, don't you have to say ""As the 18th century began and ended, legal restrictions were ....."" ? Judy?
Finally, I would like to see a more aggressive first sentence to capture readers' interest.  Something like: It may be a shock to hear the members of the press called ""enemies of the people"" but has the American press always  described a group of individuals known for their honesty and upright values?  and then go on with ""In this course we will.....""

Accept02 Oct 2018 9:16 am: Addison Stone
Agree that the CD is now more nicely focused on what the SG actually seems to be. Two possible edits: I would split the fourth sentence into two sentences, ending the first at “front and center,” deleting “as,” and beginning the next sentence with “Printers….” Also, ""review chronologically"" reads better than ""chronologically review"" to my ear.02 Oct 2018 10:31 am: Helen Bakeman
Much improved.  However, the second sentence indicates that we will explore origins of journalism/newspapers in America...wouldn’t it be more accurate to add something like “and attacks on press freedom.” I think that the SG is about both those things, yes?03 Oct 2018 8:42 pm: David Bliss
Very good revision.  I agree with helen that the second sentence should be about the origins of attacks on journalism.  To review the origin of the  entire cannon of journalism is too much for a 6-week course04 Oct 2018 5:50 pm: Katherine O'Connor

Jim is fully qualified to lead this seminar, which is squarely in his professional field. Being a potentially emotional topic, I think it’s hard to predict how popular it will be, but I think 18 is probably a sensible limit, given that discussion is central. The CD is concise and says what it needs to say. My only question is the four hours of preparation. That’s worth discussing this with him. Accept.19 Sep 2018 10:01 am: Katherine O'Connor
I agree that 4 hours of preparation stated so unequivocally should be reconsidered. Jim is obviously the ideal person to give this course. I may be wrong, but I think it will appeal to many people precisely because of its focus on the intense legal, religious, and philosophical debates surrounding the issue of “taking one’s death in hand,” as it were, rather than on the physical and psychological agonies of the dying process itself.
19 Sep 2018 12:04 pm: Helen Bakeman
Absolutely accept.  Some nits—should it be “physician-assisted?” Supreme Court should ber capitalized.19 Sep 2018 4:06 pm: Barbara Burr
Excellent and timely.  (I know Jim from HMS Ethics Consortium, and he will do a great job.)  I hope he might include some of the real-life information we have learned from states like Oregon.19 Sep 2018 4:47 pm: Mickey Zemon
Counting in at 107 words, this course description feels like it could use some enhancing.  How about a taste of some of the philosophical and religious arguments for and against PAS and/or a brief mention of some of the important state and supreme court decisions about the practice?
The first sentence suggests that PAS was not a divisive issue before the 1980s, but could this be so?
It would be so good to have a text for this course.  
The prospective SGL is so well qualified and the course so relevant that these concerns seem like small potatoes.
Accept.19 Sep 2018 8:10 pm: Ron Ebert
Captivating for our population. Should sell out. I too would like to see a text suggested. Accept19 Sep 2018 9:51 pm: Linda Neumann

I would put a hyphen between physician and assisted, but since he is knowledgeable in the field, he probably knows better.  It might be worthwhile to add a sentence about the fallout from states that have legalized PAS.20 Sep 2018 11:12 am: Addison Stone
Jim is a thoughtful, even-keeled fellow who is well qualified both substantively and experientially to lead engaging, balanced discussions of this provocative topic. Definitely accept.  I agree that some central 'text' would be helpful, if such a beast exists. Perhaps it could take the form of a few review chapters from books dealing with a broader range of issues in medical ethics. Seems to me that 'physician-assisted' should be hyphenated, even if it doesn't always appear that way in the literature.20 Sep 2018 1:46 pm: Frank Speizer
Excellent topic.  I think the 3rd sentence need to have ""...as well as legal issues ..."" added to it.  I too agree there must be a text out there that could be used as general background and that 4 hours a week seems heavy.  ACCEPT with expanded CD.  23 Sep 2018 9:10 am: Sara Freedman
Provocative and certainly timely subject, for us, led by a highly qualified SGL. Four hours is out of the norm, and needs to be discussed with the SGL. Would have liked a sample of the readings he will be offering.23 Sep 2018 8:29 pm: Penny Revelle
I think this sentence from the Other Preparation section: ""And, as an example of how a major medical group is seeking to find a way to respect the conflicting viewpoints, I will draw on my own experience with the ongoing policy review process at the American Medical Association."" could go into the CD.  It seems to me to emphasize how interesting it will be to discuss this subject with a leader who has ""skin in the game.""
I also think that 4 hours prep might be off putting to potential sgms and it hasn't been justified in this case.
If there is a ""huge literature"" on the ethics of PAS surely there is a text that could be assigned. Or if the sgl doesn't like any one in particular, then perhaps parts of more than one text?
27 Sep 2018 8:29 am: Fred Chanania
Jim:  We generally have a sort-of boilerplate for the other required materials section.  What is there isn't bad, but we probably should change it to:  The study group leader will provide excerpts from or links to other materials on the course website.02 Oct 2018 3:00 pm: Sara Freedman
Talked with Jim during the black bag. He may cut the number of participants to 12 as the topic requires a degree of intimacy among participants and 18 may be too large. Agree that he is the perfect SGL for this topic, which is certainly germaine to our members. 04 Oct 2018 6:54 am: Addison Stone
The expanded CD is a nice improvement. I’m okay with the decision to drop the cap to 12, given the topic. Jim can always offer the SG again. Apparently, Jim has decided not to use a text (still no Required Books section in the revision). Okay, but then the statement in Other Required Materials shouldn’t have the word “other” in it. Also, couldn’t that statement pick up some of the wording in the Other Preparation section (e.g., “readings exemplifying the strongest arguments…”), adding something about the types of readings (journal essays? Essays in the popular press? Position papers from major organizations? Court decisions?)

Note that “physician-assisted” is still not hyphenated in the title, or in one occurrence in the CD. Delete extraneous space in one occurrence of “physician-assisted.”04 Oct 2018 9:43 am: Helen Bakeman

Took this SG 3 years ago and enjoyed it, as did others. Definitely an 'accept.' The above editorial suggestions are reasonable, but my own recommendation would be to delete sentences 2-5 completely. Then, use the available words to say something about the marine biology theme represented by the first book but seemingly missing from the CD.20 Sep 2018 12:45 pm: Frank Speizer
Coming in late and have not taken one of these courses (scheduling problems); but would have to agree with Addison that the CD seems a ""little too casual"".  I don't think Fred needs to worry about selling this as it comes with a great reputation.  I think some more marine biology and direction and depth is required.  Eg, is it the biology of the organisms, food chain, environmental interactions, (all of the above) that the course will cover? These are mentioned, but now it seems to read somewhat as let's just enjoy a day (6 days) on the sea.  23 Sep 2018 9:13 am: Sara Freedman

This is a fabulous and very current science topic, and will be an excellent course. I’ve been in SGs lead by both Dan and Murray, and they’re both solid in their knowledge and preparation. Dan has taught evolution previously, and is a patient explainer of science. Murray, historically less patient, more but equally serious about teaching. The CD is 172 words, and needs to be cut back. I’m sure Dan, as the lead SGL, will be amenable to this, as he knows the rules from his time on the CC. The special room request is nonsense, and must be politely turned down. Tess will usually try to honor coordination requests from spouses and people with long commutes, but this definitely pushes the boundary. With these issues addressed, accept.19 Sep 2018 9:09 am: Jim Whitters
Impressive course proposal-----with Dick's recommended changes, accept.19 Sep 2018 10:20 am: Katherine O'Connor
I agree that the special requests are ludicrously presumptuous, that is, absurd. Shouldn’t the third line have a colon instead of a dash after origins?  Do 4 hours prep sound more defensible and less off-putting here because the course is so obviously a demanding one. Should something be said to warn/discourage the “genomically ignorant”?
Accept.
19 Sep 2018 11:59 am: Helen Bakeman
Very impressive and timely course proposal.  One place to get rid of words is delete the list of places in the second sentence and replace with “all over the world”....but at least get rid of the “even” before “Africa.”  I do think that the CD contains sufficient language that makes it clear that this will be accessible to the layperson.  Hurrah for the brief bios.19 Sep 2018 3:55 pm: Barbara Burr
A good topic - I agree with the above comments, esp the language of the scheduling request.  I do wonder whether the SG is mostly descriptive or whether there are other sorts of insights to be gleaned from learning about about migration, population mixing,  etc...19 Sep 2018 4:13 pm: Mickey Zemon
I agree with all of the above comments for trimming down the description and declining the special request. Also agree that this is an important and interesting course led by two excellent study group leaders.19 Sep 2018 8:03 pm: Ron Ebert
Yes to shortening the cd by removing all that geography. Will the requirement that all members do a presentation limit applicants? As for the special room request - ha ha19 Sep 2018 10:05 pm: Linda Neumann
Dan and Murray are excellent SGLs, very thorough and precise in their preparations and presentations.  This will be a challenging and exciting course.  The book is excellent.  They do not require member presentations, only that the members do some research in a topic that will be discussed.  Idea is that they will participate more actively in that discussion.  4 hours prep is realistic for their courses.  Accept, after some editing to shorten the CD.  Special requests - perplexing20 Sep 2018 10:41 am: David Bliss
Excellent topic for a study group.  The long CD could be shortened by dropping the phrases in parentheses.20 Sep 2018 10:49 am: Addison Stone
Agree with all of the above comments. I've taken SG's with both, and although they assign challenging material and set a high bar for discussion, they both do a good job of making sure that SGM's are 'with them' (having already discouraged some potentially inadequately prepared SGM's by means of the CD!). Murray used the SGM special-preparation approach in a study group last year and it worked well. No presentation, but he did expect the relevant SGM to chime in substantively and often during the relevant week. Accept with minor edits, ignoring the scheduling request.22 Sep 2018 8:02 am: Susan Harris
I took an evolution class with Murray as SGL and Dan as an especially helpful SGM.  It was challenging even for those of us with science background, but I found it well worth the work - one of the best courses I've taken here.  This proposed course has a similar format and I would expect it to work equally well.  The 4 hr prep time does seem excessive.   Accept after minor editing as described above and possible reduction of the workload.  And yes, haha to the room request.23 Sep 2018 9:20 am: Sara Freedman
Agree with all of the above comments - the course topic is important and will draw many members, the format is well designed and has the potential to increase the participation of members in class discussions. Four hours is a lot but given the topic and the reading, may be realistic, as many members may have to read the selections at least more than once. Ignore the scheduling request - it is bizarre to say the least. What if everyone followed their lead?23 Sep 2018 8:04 pm: Penny Revelle
I think the CD is well written and explains exactly what sgms will be getting into if they sign up.  That said, the second sentence could probably be deleted without losing any important information.  I would also leave in the 4 hours of prep time - best to be up front about it if the course will require a lot of time.
I'd love to be able to make a scheduling request like that but so would we all.  I can't see how Tess would be able to honor it.23 Sep 2018 8:13 pm: Penny Revelle
addendum:  I would like to see a few words in the bio's about the sgls' background, if applicable, or why this topic interests them if their backgrounds are not.24 Sep 2018 9:26 am: Frank Speizer

This class will have great appeal to non-scientists, like myself,  as well as many scientists from other fields.
I don't think Study Group should have an upper case S and G and that Various after the colon in the fifth sentence should have an upper case V.  Electromagnetic is one word -- is there a reason for it and Spectrum to start with upper case letters?
Not sure about starting the last sentences with As a bonus -- the whole course sounds like a bonus to me.
The last sentence is not a complete sentence.
There is a typo in the title.

Great idea!  Agree with the above edits regarding caps etc.  Might leave out ""such"" in front of spectacular...In the bio, might say ""which involved"" instead of ""involving.""18 Sep 2018 8:47 pm: Penny Revelle
Because this is a course about light as well as other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum I believe is an ideal place to use videos in class to engage sgms as well as to stimulate discussion. A course composed entirely of lectures, as is suggested by the last sentence, would be less appealing to potential sgms.  If that's not what she means, ie if she does intend to have a variety of materials in her presentations, I think she should say what they might be.19 Sep 2018 6:58 am: Dick Rubinstein
This can be a good course. We have plenty of non-scientists who are curious and will jump in. I agree with Penny that the course need not be straight lecture. In addition to videos, I think the topic begs for demonstrations and experiments. What fun! Accept, with the above preening of the CD, and also in bio “hopes to stimulate a curiosity  science” rather than .19 Sep 2018 8:50 am: Addison Stone
Sounds like a good way to engage non-scientists in some interesting phenomena. I agree with others that the final sentence (""primarily SGL presentations"") may be off-putting. It's clear from the Other Materials and Other Preparation that many videos and 'images' will be included in those presentations, so it isn't just lecture. However, that could be clearer in the actual CD. In the CD, I came to a halt at the phrase ""will tour the spectrum."" I assume that that is an intentional pun, but somehow it misfires for me. I'd phrase it more prosaically. Agree with other suggested edits.19 Sep 2018 10:33 am: Katherine O'Connor
This sounds like it will be a science course that is truly targeted to the non-scientists. I agree with  Mickey’s comments. I do think that many of those who are interested in this topic will tolerate a fairly large input by the SGL. The sentence that stars with”This” at the end of line 6 needs to be reworked following the colon after “spectrum.” Accept.19 Sep 2018 7:57 pm: Ron Ebert
Yes, prune as above. Should be an interesting course19 Sep 2018 9:45 pm: Jim Whitters
Accept with above mentioned changes----interesting, and different, course.20 Sep 2018 10:35 am: Susan Harris
Great idea.  Agree with the minor edits, especially removing some caps and adding ""and.""  Personally, I think there should be a place in the catalog for some courses, like this one, that are mainly presentations from the SGL.  Such courses are best when the SGM is very well versed in the topic area - and Linda is.20 Sep 2018 1:00 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with much of above, but would be cautious about suggesting too much.  Linda seems to be offering an introductory course to non-scientist of a topic that should be of interest to a significant pool and by stating it as a lecture course with time for questions will be attractive.  On the other hand, if she gets int more ""hands on demonstrations"" rather than videos the appeal might change significantly.  I think what she has proposed will work, and leave it up to her to decide how much further she would want to take it.  ACCEPT23 Sep 2018 9:26 am: Sara Freedman
The topic is fascinating and I appreciate her appeal to and sensitivity toward non-scientists. That said, I think the course would greatly benefit from some kind of ""hands-on"" experiences as well as discussions that help members explore the extent to which they understand the lectures and videos. It is my experience that without these additions, we tend to think we ""get"" the material but often don't. 24 Sep 2018 11:10 am: David Bliss

Instead, be prepared to discover the range and depth of Dylan’s literary and cultural impact through the poetic power of his songs. For more than 50 years, Dylan has addressed the issue of social justice, war and the human response to war, love and death, faith and religion, songs as compensation for the realities of mortality, the very stuff of poetry.

Sounds like awinner. Well written cd( is it within the word limit?). Interesting idea teaching it twice- how about spring, then fall? Would she use the colloquium room and fill it with 25 and ease the pressure on herself.? Book  is only 14.95 on amazon- why not have class buy it?14 Sep 2018 8:11 pm: Mickey Zemon
Agree with Ron that this is a winner!
Sentence starting with Instead be prepared: I think ""as he addresses"" should be ""as he addressed""
Same sentence: add an ""and"" between religion, songs -- ""religion, and songs""
Same sentence: It would help if ""as Harvard Professor Richard Thomas says in his book Why Bob Dylan Matters, the text for this class"" was placed in parenthesis at the end of the sentence since it is a very long sentence as it now stands.
I do not know how many lyrics Kate is planning to copy for the course but there may be copyright issues here.  My advice is to let Gnomen Copy service on Mass Ave do it since they handle  Fair Use issues all the time.  They get the copyright clearance and they charge the students for the packet.  However, if the lyrics are available on Google, they are already in the public domain and she could just post them on her course website.  
She says in her proposal that the book by Thomas is the text for the course but under Other Req. Materials she says it is optional.  I think it is important to have a text for the class and to use it as basis for discussions.
Regarding her special request under Further Information: that is breaking a long-standing precedent that perhaps should be broken but to do so is going to take some doing.14 Sep 2018 11:45 pm: Linda Neumann
Probably will be very popular.  The idea of having double sessions is interesting,  but  don't see it happening.  It could be offered again in the fall (as Gene Ferrari's HIstory of the Earth was this year.)

Agree with Ron and Mickey that the text book issue should be clear.  If she calls it the text of the class, it should not be optional.  Amazon has plenty of used copies under 15$. 15 Sep 2018 10:29 am: Jim Whitters
lucid and straightforward-----think it best that the course be presented once in the Spring and if it is a popular success present again next Fall or Spring, 2019.15 Sep 2018 2:54 pm: Barbara Burr
Excellent topic. Agree with above comments.  One can also buy on Amazon the”Complete Lyrics,” 1961-2016, for less than $20 if bought second hand, and many copies are available.  Agreetext should b e used; it is also inexpensive if bought 2nd hand.15 Sep 2018 4:41 pm: Dick Rubinstein
Ron’s right. Its 178 words. I’ll work with Kate to get it down to 150.
I will consult with the co-chairs about having two sections. The issue of course isn’t that exactly, but postponing the priority course selection, which seems like a bad precedent. What do you think about suggesting a single section, and repeating it in the Fall or Spring if it’s popular?16 Sep 2018 2:54 pm: Fred Chanania
From Fred C:  We should discuss this proposal soon as a Committee, but my initial reaction is that we should not recommend two sections of this class.  Perhaps we will be so sorely lacking in proposals for the spring that we may have plenty of open spots in the scheduling matrix, and that would make this somehow more attractive.  I do not anticipate this eventuality, and I think this may have some serious unintended consequences (for example, the self-nominated ""best"" SGLs with their 'loyal"" following may start to request the same type of preferential treatment at the potential expense of new SGLs).  Ultimately, Tess may have the final word as a matter of policy, but I think the CC views would be important for her to hear.  I, too, an very interested in hearing all views, especially opposing ones).  Meanwhile, comments on the proposal itself should proceed as the two section request does not interfere with our CC work at this stage.17 Sep 2018 10:51 am: Penny Revelle
The proposal is intriguing and should be well received but it comes in at 178 words.  I suggest deleting ""- songs as compensation for the realities of mortality,” as Harvard Professor Richard Thomas says in his book Why Bob Dylan Matters, the text for this class."" which is a great line but makes the sentence much too long.  The quote could be used prominently on the course web page.  Also that gets round saying it is the text for this class when the text is optional.  But, to this point, the text even though hardcover, is only $12 on Amazon, so I don't see any reason for listing it as optional. (Maybe that changed after Kate wrote her proposal?) 17 Sep 2018 2:04 pm: Katherine O'Connor
I am very wary of offering two sections of this course in one term - for all the reasons given and for additional concerns not stated. I agree that the Thomas book should be required, especially since the cost is hardly prohibitive. I frankly thought that the concluding sentence of the description was bizarre since it seems very unlikely to me that those who signed up would be looking for a course that trashed the Nobel Committee for giving Dylan the prize! Also, everything about the CD suggests that this is a course celebrating Dylan.17 Sep 2018 5:15 pm: Frank Speizer
Would agree with Ron and Mickey about buying the book. CD need to indicate homework time. Accept her proposal on having a deferred 1st choice if she teaches 2 sessions. (Although the suggestion of giving the course over 2 semesters would also work, but I would leave that preference to SGL. Nice to think about more flexibility in our program in general, and this may just be one example. ACCEPT17 Sep 2018 5:41 pm: David Bliss
I am sure this course will be popular, but we won't know how popular until after the schedule has been posted in the catalog.  So it would be better to postpone the second session until next fall.  The price of the book is not a real issue: used copies are available for under $20.
19 Sep 2018 8:31 am: Addison Stone
I agree that this is an attractive course proposal. Also agree that a second offering in fall 2019 is a better option for handling the (still hypothetical) demand. That would allow Tess to see how long the spring waitlist is. Re CD length, I agree with Penny about cutting the phrase from the Thomas quote. In addition to making the sentence quite long, I had trouble parsing the sentence with that phrase included. Two other possible cuts to bring the word length down: Cut ""Do not expect to sing...."", and also ""to bestow a Nobel Prize on Bob Dylan"" (obvious).22 Sep 2018 8:16 am: Susan Harris
I agree the book should be required and that a second session should not be offered until the fall.  Accept after editing for length as suggested above.  I do find it a bit odd that there will apparently be no listening to Dylan songs, but Kate has expressed a clear preference for focusing on lyrics alone and should be allowed to do that.  There is certainly enough meat for discussion in the lyrics alone.23 Sep 2018 9:35 am: Sara Freedman
Agree with the wise comments above. Suggestion to hold two sessions of the same class is bizarre, to me, as there are so many wonderful courses that I don't think members will mind if they don't get this course this particular semester. If there is indeed an oversubscription, she can offer it any following semester. Think sentence starting with ""Instead..."" is too long and winding. Needs to be two sentences or edit out quote from book. Idea of buying book with all of the lyrics seems an easy way around copyright issues. Making the book about Dylan required makes sense.23 Sep 2018 2:11 pm: Mickey Zemon
This is certainly a much improved proposal.  
Is there a reason she decided not to use the book?
I do not know how many lyrics Kate plans to copy but if these represent a large portion of his work she is pushing the limits of Fair Use.  It is better to have Gnomen make the copies and get the copyright clearance first.  This is what Judy Herman did in her poetry class.23 Sep 2018 5:54 pm: Dick Rubinstein

Wonderful proposal.  I hesitate to suggest a word change, but would Michael consider substituting resurrection for renaissance in the first sentence - just to continue the metaphor?17 Sep 2018 2:13 pm: Katherine O'Connor
Great idea for a course. My only quibblet is the opening ""Seemingly left for dead.."" I think this is too strong a metaphor for the state of Yiddish literature before its ""renaissance.""  It's certainly true that it is experiencing a ""renaissance"" but writers like Singer have been been consistently ""very much read."" 
Accept.17 Sep 2018 5:05 pm: Frank Speizer
Very little to add as I agree an outstanding SGL has done it again. We can be sure this one will be oversubscribed. I have one quibble. The second sentence says..”works consigned to the trash collector”. I fear that there will be a few members who might be offended as this might remind them of the 1930s book burnings, and it really doesn’t have to said this way. Leave it if Michael is comfortable but point it out to him.  With minor editsACCEPT18 Sep 2018 10:04 am: David Bliss
Bravo to a course that will bring a new canon of literature to HILR.  One question: The ""other preparation"" adds interest, but I am not sure if it will be included in the course catalog. If it is included, it will add significantly to the word limit for course proposals. 19 Sep 2018 8:01 am: Addison Stone
I agree that this is a winner. No editorial suggestions beyond what has already been mentioned. However, I wonder if there is a way to link the description more effectively to the title.

Another creative course idea from a fabulously popular SGL.  ""No knowledge of Yiddish required"" seems unnecessary in the CD.  Accept.23 Sep 2018 9:42 am: Sara Freedman
Wonderful course with terrific SGL. My one quibble is linking the haskelah with the emergence of Yiddish writers. They certainly benefited from the introduction of modern philosophy to Jewish life, including the new trends in writing such as the novel and the short story, but the haskelah to my knowledge is generally connected with championing the use of Hebrew, not Yiddish, as a modern means of communication and a plea for integrating Jews into their surrounding communities. Yiddish literature does not have these emphases, and much of it emphasizes the uniqueness of Jewish life and the need to retain that uniqueness in the light of  incursions from modernizing trends such as the Haskelah.24 Sep 2018 5:38 pm: Barbara Burr

Known as “The Metaphysical Club,” the group included such luminaries as William James, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., and Charles S. Peirce. Of special concern were two large questions: (1) In an intellectual environment dominated by scientific and technological approaches to the world, does ethics any longer have a secure foundation? (2) In an increasingly diverse and democratic political order, what is the proper role of intellectual elites? The group’s intense discussions gave birth to America’s distinctive contribution to philosophical thought – Pragmatism – with its emphasis on practical modes of thinking: open, experimental, fallible, tolerant, heuristic, and self-corrective. In our study group, we will explore the central ideas of Pragmatism and consider its continuing influence on American culture.

Cambridge, Massachusetts -- there is another Cambridge where intellectuals gather
Second sentence and last sentence say pretty much the same thing, so delete one or the other

Divide up that long 4th sentence -- for instance, a period after Metaphysical Club.  Next sentence: These members, including William James . . . , engaged in intense discussions on the place of religion and morality ... and the place of intellectual elites ....

Interesting course.  I agree that the fourth sentence is too long and that “Massachusetts” should be added.  The other suggested changes strike me as matters of personal preference -- things that we might suggest but should not insist on.14 Sep 2018 11:37 am: Linda Neumann
Agree that the first sentence does not really introduce us to the topic.  Fourth sentence should be broken up in order to beter emphasize the issues which appear at the end and seem to be the heart of this course.  Like it.14 Sep 2018 12:15 pm: Linda Neumann
Two more points.  Is he planning on lectures or discussions?  Any special reaon he limits to 12 participants?  I think there could be healthy demand for this course.16 Sep 2018 2:45 pm: Fred Chanania
Addison:  I don't usually comment on proposals at this stage but I wanted to tell you that, since you are new to the CC, this proposal is pretty lacking in my view.   I do not find this ""interesting"" or ""attractive"" for most HILR'ers.   It is true that the SGL has identified the topic and some critical questions or themes that will be ""explored"" but that's as far as it goes in terms of:  what will the SGMs experience in class?  how will the readings be used in terms of the focus of a class, or just as an adjunct to the discussion?  how much prep time is expected?  what is the relevance of the course to today's pressing problems (or is it just for history buffs and there is not much meat to provoke thinking about today's world).  It's not enough to have the throw away sentence at the end of the CD saying it's relevant to today.  How is it going to be relevant?  If a person is absolutely interested in this slice of philosophical history, they may take this class but there is no ""selling point"" for a regular person to get excited about.  Personally, I am not sure this will attract the minimum number of sign-ups, so I think that the SGL needs to figure out how to entice folks into taking this course.   17 Sep 2018 11:23 am: Penny Revelle
I agree that the first, second and last sentences are weak in terms of drumming up member interest, but disagree  that the CD as written wouldn't draw much interest from the members - the mention of the authors to be discussed should ensure that. (I like the idea of including Emerson and maybe a sentence about how his work would be used - in contrast to the pragmatists?) However, I think a definition of pragmatism would help and could be a first sentence.17 Sep 2018 2:20 pm: Katherine O'Connor
Weak concluding sentence, too long second-to-last sentence, and yes, there is more than one Cambridge. Otherwise, I think it's a great subject for a SG. 17 Sep 2018 5:23 pm: Frank Speizer
Agree with last 3-4 comments. The subject could be interesting but the CD needs a re-write to give it more meat and a suggestion on perspectives that will be discussed.  Extra gratuitous remake after philosophy degrees should go. 17 Sep 2018 5:28 pm: David Bliss
Here is a question that might help to focus the CD: How did 19th century Americans switch from idealistic  transcendentalism to pragmatic social science?  After the civil war, they threw out the received Biblical wisdom of our ancestors for a new pragmatism based on experience.  Good topic and good books.18 Sep 2018 9:17 am: Helen Bakeman
With a better course description, I believe tat this will be a popular course. First sentence should start with something about pragmatism, as in What could be more American than a philosophy of  pragmatism?  Then go on to the 3rd sentence and  also a definition of pragmatism in comparison to what had come before. Bio—take out date of his retirement18 Sep 2018 3:40 pm: Jim Whitters
superb subject for a course but concur with the above comments recommending a re-write with more substance.23 Sep 2018 9:47 am: Sara Freedman
Agree with Fred's comments. SGL seems supremely qualified but he may be so steeped in the subject matter that he assumes others know more about the topic than they actually do. Course has wonderful potential but needs a good discussion of pragmatism, specific examples of intriguing topics that the course will explore, and specific ways it will address topics important to today.  24 Sep 2018 8:55 am: Addison Stone
[Workflow note] All,
Ken Winston has used our collective input to create a revised CD. My sense is that he has done a great job of addressing the various concerns, and that the CD should be much more appealing. However, since it is totally rewritten, I would like your input as well. Please take a look and submit comments.

The CD is much better. Good work, Addison! I think the bio could still use a little work. It relates to the topic by mentioning work on Pragmatism, but still doesn’t indicate why the SLG is interested in the topic. I think that would make the proposal stronger. Accept.24 Sep 2018 10:58 am: Linda Neumann
An excellent revision.  You have succeeded in presenting the course in a very interesting and clear way.  Should be popular.  Accept.24 Sep 2018 4:40 pm: Ron Ebert
good rewrite and better bio. Accept24 Sep 2018 8:16 pm: Mickey Zemon
A great improvement!  Accept24 Sep 2018 10:17 pm: Jim Whitters

Far clearer. Accept25 Sep 2018 1:09 pm: Sara Freedman
Improved - clear, succinct, engaging.30 Sep 2018 8:20 am: Addison Stone
[Workflow note] The 7 folks who've weighed in on the revised CD are all happy. No new comment since Sep 24, so I assume we're ready to vote
