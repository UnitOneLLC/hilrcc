"Whatever the Title Is!","Active","","","","","Spring 2019","First Half","","Government/Economics/Current Issues","If you want to clean up your carbon footprint, cut lobster and shrimp from your diet. That’s what a new study suggests after finding that these fisheries chug through huge quantities of fuel and produce almost a quarter of global fisheries emissions.","","Francis","","Hayakawa","","fred.hewett@gmail.com","555 341 1212","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","The new <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0117-x""><i>Nature Climate Change</i> study</a> finds that since 1990, emissions from fishing overall have surged by a striking 28%, despite production staying the same. That means that the emissions load per ton of catch has shot up by 21% over just 20 years, because of more intensive fuel use. Our appetite for crustaceans, it turns out, is the primary culprit.","In just a few decades, the rising popularity of lobster and shrimp has driven a 60% increase in production, the study found. Paired with the more intensive fuel use that shrimp and lobster trawling methods require, these fisheries have become the biggest drivers of fishing-related emissions increase: today they account for 22% of the emissions total, despite making up just 6% of global catch landings. In fact, the results suggested that lobster and shrimp fisheries produced enough emissions to outstrip chicken and pork farming, and that certain fisheries even produced <a href=""http://www.iflscience.com/environment/weve-got-bad-news-if-youre-eating-shrimp-and-lobster-to-shrink-your-carbon-footprint/all/"">more than beef</a>.","The researchers made these detailed comparisons by combining data from a huge repository called the Fisheries Energy Use Database, with data on global fish landings. That made it possible to calculate the emissions by fishery, country, and year–spanning the decades between 1990 and 2011 to reveal the huge extent of change. This showed that in 2011 alone, fishing vessels used up an estimated 40 billion litres of fuel, which released 179 million tons of CO2 equivalent into the atmosphere.","","Tuesday AM","Wednesday AM","Monday AM","20","","I cannot use the Colloquium Room.","And, for those of us trying to reduce our own impact on the planet, there’s appears to be a new option on the menu: switching that prawn cocktail for a less fuel-intensive fish.","","","","33","2018-04-06 17:18:36","http://ccsubmit.com/","","","","","","Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/65.0.3325.181 Safari/537.36","73.149.18.45","","pending","","","","","","","","","","","pending","1","1523049516"

Price had elbow trouble throughout 2017 (6-3 in 11 starts) and did not start for the Sox in the playoffs, but turned out to be Boston’s best postseason pitcher, slamming the door on the World Champion Astros twice in relief.

Our Endless Energy panel is a superior monocrystalline 60 cell panel. Offering high efficiency triple bypass diodes, this panel is over 20% more efficient than its competitors. Having high efficiency panels requires fewer panels to be installed to generate the same, if not more, energy making it ideal for restricted spaces and saving money. A lightweight and sturdy aluminum frame and hail storm resistant panels makes this setup sturdy, secure, and cost effective.
