<strong>Break Workflow</strong><br><br>
As a CCsubmit Admin, you can make arbitrary changes to the workflow of a
proposal, by moving the proposal into any workflow step. Please be sure you
understand the consequences of the change you are about to make. If you don’t, please
ask for help before taking any action.<br><br>
When you move a proposal to a different workflow step, the normal email
announcements for entering that step will be sent, and the proposal will then appear in
Inboxes, as appropriate to that step, if all of its settings are correct. <br><br>
These arbitrary workflow changes are sometimes needed to mark a proposal as
Withdrawn or Mistake, to Defer it to a later term, or to change the Sponsor. For these
actions, follow the directions at <a target="_other" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eMV-X3M4sIJiXdm-IYsCV2fcYSN98FLI5OAhFHDKiSg/edit?usp=sharing">How to Remove Proposals from the Current Process</a>.
Please report any other need to use Workflow Controls to the CCsubmit System
Admin.
