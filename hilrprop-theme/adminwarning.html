<strong>Break Workflow</strong><br><br>
As a CCsubmit Admin, you can make arbitrary changes to the workflow of a proposal, by moving the proposal into any workflow step. Please be sure you understand the consequences of the change you are about to make. If you donâ€™t, please ask for help before taking any action.<br><br>
When you move a proposal to a different workflow step, the normal email announcements for entering that step will be sent, and the proposal will then appear in Inboxes, as appropriate to that step. <br><br>
These arbitrary workflow changes are very rarely needed. Please report any need to use them to the CCsubmit System Admin.
